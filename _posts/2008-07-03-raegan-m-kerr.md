Raegan`s free spirit passed on July 3, 2008. His family and friends will miss him dearly. A video dedicated to his life can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgdR0tdCX0U).

Note: It is unclear if Raegan actually graduated from Interlake. Some people say he graduated from Interlake, others say he graduated from Sammamish. He definitely attended both schools at some point though.
