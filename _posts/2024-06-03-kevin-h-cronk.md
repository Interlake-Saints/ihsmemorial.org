It is with unbelievable sadness that I share that my husband, Kevin Howard Cronk, died on May 19, 2024 at home with his wife, mom, and his dogs by his side. He had just turned 59. Kevin leaves a gigantic hole in the lives of many with his wife and dogs trying their best to find their way forward without their Kevin. For those that may not know, Kevin fought valiantly against Diabetes and End Stage Renal Disease and had recently made the impossibly hard decision to stop dialysis treatment after Swedish Hospital removed him from the transplant list.

Kevin was a HUGE lover of music, vintage cars, Jeeps, dogs, UW, Portland Trailblazers, Chicago Bears, Mariners, and DUKE! Knowing Kevin meant you had a friend for life.  He had a wicked sense of humor, quick wit, and an uncanny way of bringing people together from different places and spaces. He loved playing poker with the guys as well as the competitive fun involved with fantasy football. He married Kathryn Missel (IHS) in 2020 and they fought his disease, as well as the healthcare system, side by side until the very last second.

Kevin had a great love for animals, specifically dogs. Abby was very attached to Kevin, sticking by his side as the disease advanced. She had been rescued-adopted by Kevin and Kathy from an organization called "Mikey's Chance". If you would like to make a donation to the organization in Kevin's name, he would be thrilled at the thought of saving more dogs like his Abby-Girl. You can make a donation at <https://www.mikeyschance.com/>. Mikey's Chance is a non-profit organization, headquartered in the Tri-Cities in south-central Washington State. They focus mainly on saving dogs that are at risk in the region and placing them with adopters throughout the Pacific Northwest. Most of the dogs come from shelters in Washington & Idaho, where they are facing the threat of Euthanasia or are either dumped or abandoned, and need a chance at a new life.

To say that Kevin will be missed is a huge understatement. Thinking of Kevin, a quote comes to mind. "No music-No life. Know music-Know life". Kevin Cronk lived life to the fullest.   

Note: Kevin's wife Kathy asked a few of Kevin's friends to share some of their memories of him. You can find those in the comments below.
