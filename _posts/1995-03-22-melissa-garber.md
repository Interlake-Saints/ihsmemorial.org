Melissa died in a car accident on March 22, 1995. She was a saleswoman for Pacific Food Service, a food brokerage company,ï»¿ and she died on her way to a catering gig she had booked. A male friend was driving her to Wenatchee when they were struck by an oncoming truck in Blewett Pass. She was a student at the University of Washington at the time, and she would have graduated with honors two months after her death. 

Melissa was an avid rose gardener and enjoyed skiing, hiking and bicycling with her husband, Don Simmons. She also enjoyed her dog, Jake. Her door was always open to her many friends and to neighborhood children and dogs. Those who knew her say she touched everyone with her friendliness and joy.

Sadly, Melissa's husband, [Don Simmons](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1986/donald-mark-simmons/), is also listed on the IHS Memorial Wall. She was married to him at the time of her death. Don died nineteen years later in Nevada.
