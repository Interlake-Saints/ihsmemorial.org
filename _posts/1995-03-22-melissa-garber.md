Melissa died in a car accident on March 22, 1995. She was a saleswoman for Pacific Food Service, a food brokerage company. She attended the University of Washington, and would have graduated with honors two months after her death. Melissa was an avid rose gardener and enjoyed skiing, hiking and bicycling with her husband, Don Simmons. She also enjoyed her dog, Jake. Her door was always open to her many friends and to neighborhood children and dogs. Those who knew her say she touched everyone with her friendliness and joy.

Sadly, Melissa's husband, [Don Simmons](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1986/donald-mark-simmons/), is also listed on the IHS Memorial Wall. She was married to him at the time of her death. Don died nineteen years later in Nevada.
