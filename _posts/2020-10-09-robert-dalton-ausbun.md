Bobby was born in Tacoma and lived in Puyallup until he was thirteen years old. He then moved to Bellevue where he attended and graduated from Interlake.

Bobby was ten pounds when he was born and was always a tall boy. He reached 6'6" by the time he was 16 years old. He played baseball and football, but he was much better known as a basketball player. He started playing basketball when he was four years old at the YMCA and played on numerous teams growing up, including the Viking Elite Basketball program in Puyallup. He always made sure his parents were watching.

Bobby had many friends around the world through his love for online gaming. He also followed his mom's passion for cooking, and loved anything spicy. He enjoyed making pico de gallo from fresh tomatoes and onions from her garden. His favorite foods were Mexican and McDonald's. Bobby also loved the water, especially boating on Lake Taps with his dad. He loved jet skiing, boating, fishing, and playing Marco Polo. He was employed at QFC in Bellevue in the meat/seafood department at the time of his death.

In 2019, Bobby got his wisdom teeth removed, and he was prescribed pain medicine. And unfortunately, that's where he began an addiction to opioid pills. He was clean for seven-and-a-half months, however, until the night of October 9th, 2020. For whatever reason, he got his hands on a little blue pill of street Percocet, and he took it before going to bed. The pill had been laced with fentanyl, though, and Bobby never woke up. Three doses of Narcan were used to try and revive him, but it was too late. He still had his entire life ahead of him. He was only 20 years old.
