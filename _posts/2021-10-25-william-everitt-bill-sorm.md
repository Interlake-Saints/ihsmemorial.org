Bill passed from multiple organ failure due to a sudden resurgence of a septic infection from a previous surgery, which we didn’t recognize quickly enough.  Instead, assuming it was understandable sadness at the recent passing of his Mom on April 28, who he’d been devoted to for all her care the past 11 months.

Born and raised in Bellevue, WA to Jiri and Peggy Sorm, he is survived by his Father, Jiri; his wife, Jessica and his three stepchildren; Alex, Erica and Will.  His sister, Alena, having passed some years earlier due to cancer.  He is greatly missed by all who knew him, being such a charming personality who liked everyone, and the feeling was mutual.   He and his wife were a popular couple around town and many local concerts and events.

As a young man he attended Interlake high school where he earned his nickname, Bill the Cat (or just Cat eventually) for a character from a popular cartoon strip “Opus” due to his often showing up at school injured or on crutches from his early efforts to become a professional hockey player.  Which had some brief success, when he played for The Breakers.  At least until someone threw a penny on the ice which he hit at speed and came to across the arena with his knee turned the wrong way around.  That ended that career.  He always loved the sport and coached peewees for a while.  A recent commercial depicting 5-6 year old hockey kids helping each other stand up on the ice always choked us up and we would say “look babe, it’s your kids!”  Such good memories.

Bill’s love of music was a natural progression of being a Bellevue kid where so many other talents grew up.   His regular babysitter was best friends with Ann and Nancy Wilson (of Heart) and many guitar sessions took place in the early days in his living room.   His desire to become a drummer inspired his Mom to gift him with a trombone (right?).  When he eventually got a guitar his talent really showed and almost took him down another road, having received several offers.  But, never comfortable playing in front of an audience, he eventually went to work for the family business instead.

His love of the outdoors; (skiing, surfing, golfing, rock climbing, etc) served him well in the family’s business of recovering and restoring crashed aircraft, as much of this work was done in the Alaskan backcountry.  Although it took him all over the world, and he knew many notable people and celebrities because of it.  His integrity was always to give 110% to everything he did, or he wouldn’t bill you for it.  We would watch if an aircraft went down, as he would always hurry to check if it was one he’d worked on.  He held several special licenses/certifications, and if his name was on the paperwork he made sure there were no questions or errors in anything.  He always said he loved airplanes but not aviation, because of the paperwork!

Sadly, Bill's sister Alena is also on this page. She died of cancer in 2001, and is listed under the [Class of 1985](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1982/alena-maria-sorm/).
