After graduating from Interlake, Waylon attended the Culinary Institute of Seattle, where he learned his skills as a chef and cultivated his love for cooking. This led to numerous jobs in the restaurant industry throughout Bellevue, Kirkland, and Redmond. Sadly, he was found dead in a car on May 10, 2021. The official cause of death was anoxic encephalopathy (brain damage, unknown cause). He was only 28 years old.

Waylon was a fun-loving young man who loved his family and friends. He was always willing to lend a hand and help where needed. He will be greatly missed.
