Dorn was a manager at an equipment rental company at the time of his death. And he always seemed positive and upbeat, right up until the end. He ultimately committed suicide one night after drinking and smoking marijuana with friends. He was only thirty years old.

Dorn's death, on July 10, 1998, caught all of his friends off guard, because no one had known he had been suffering from depression. And this is why his friends want his story to be told, so people know that depression is a real affliction. If Dorn's friends had known that, they feel like they could have helped him.

"Dorn had a lisp. He found it hard to have relationships because of that. He was such a sweet man."
