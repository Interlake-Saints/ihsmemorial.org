James' father was a career military man, and his mother was a Red Cross nurse, so his family lived in many different areas over the years. Even though he was Class of 1978 he did not actually graduate from Interlake, he graduated from a different school.

James loved classic Buicks, and he was especially proud of his 1965 Buick Special Convertible that he got when he was fifteen years old. He also enjoyed the outdoors â€“ camping, hunting, loud music, and Bigfoot. Later in his life, he owned businesses in both Oregon and Washington. In 2018, he retired to Ocean Shores.

Sadly, James McClinton passed away on February 21, 2023, at his home in Hoquiam. He was 62 years old.
