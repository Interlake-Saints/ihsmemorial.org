Kevin was born in Chicago, Illinois, as the first-born son of Ruth and Howard McCoy. He spent his early life in Bellevue, when it was still full of forest and frog ponds. He loved to laugh and explore the forest with his brother Tim and neighborhood friends.

After graduating from Interlake, he attended college at Western Washington University in Bellingham. Seattle eventually became his home, and he worked in the restaurant industry his adult life. The notable restaurants he worked at as a waiter were Daniel's Broiler and, most recently until his retirement, Ruth's Chris Steak House in Seattle.

He was married in Long Beach, Washington, to Karen Kane. After a short time living on San Juan Island, where Kevin loved to scuba dive, they settled back in Seattle. His love of a good story - with friends, good food, and better wine - was his passion. He loved his Border Collie Beau, who was his constant companion, and with Karen they enjoyed vacations to the Oregon Coast and Columbia River.

Kevin passed away peacefully on December 26, 2024. He was 68 years old. He is survived by his mother Ruth; his brother Tim (Jean); his nephews Matt, Duncan, and Riley; and his former wife and loving friend and companion, Karen.
