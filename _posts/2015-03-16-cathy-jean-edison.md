Cass had an exciting and illustrious life, where at various times she worked as an investigative journalist, a radio broadcaster, an inventor, an equestrienne, and an artist. But she fell on hard times in her later years. Sadly, she died in Chico, California on March 16, 2015, when she was murdered by an acquaintance. She was 55 years old.

In response to her death, her family formed a non-profit organization called Cass's Law, which is designed to protect the lives of women and children from habitual violent offenders.

Tragically, Cass is not the only member of her family on the IHS Memorial Wall. Her younger brother, [Kirk Edison](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1980/kirk-william-edison/), is also listed here, under the Class of 1980.
