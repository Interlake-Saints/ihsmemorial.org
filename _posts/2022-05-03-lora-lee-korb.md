Lora lived in the Tri-Cities and also The Dalles, and eventually passed away in Hermiston, Oregon. She was very fond of her family and animals and especially her faith in Jesus. She always had a pet cat or dog. Sadly, she died of ALS on February 12, 2018.

Unfortunately, Lora is not the only member of the Korb family on the IHS Memorial Wall. Her brother, [Rich Korb](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1973/richard-d-rich-korb/), passed away two years after she did.
