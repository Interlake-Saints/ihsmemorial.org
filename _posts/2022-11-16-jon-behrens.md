Jon Behrens was a prolific and well-known Seattle filmmaker, whose films were screened at film festivals, colleges, and museums throughout the world, going back to the early 80s. He was also the man behind the creation of the Interbay Cinema Society, the Engaguge Experimental Film Festival, and the Lightpress Filmmaker Grant, all of which still exist today. He was a titan among the Seattle independent film community, and his loss to his friends, family, and fans is going to be huge.

According to Jon's friends, "His total, full-body-and-mind artistic commitment to experimental film and music was such a dependable source of inspiration for everyone. That creative dedication was enough to stop us in our tracks and make us think: Should we run home and spend the rest of the day on art? For Jon, the answer always seemed to be an emphatic yes. He reminded us to always take time to appreciate – in every sense of the word – the artists in your life." 

Jon battled illness for some time, before passing away on Monday, September 5th, 2022. 

If you want to offer a tribute to Jon Behrens, he would want you to go out and make an experimental film.
