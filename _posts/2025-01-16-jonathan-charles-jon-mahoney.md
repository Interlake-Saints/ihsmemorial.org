Born in Syracuse, NY, Jon lived in Ontario, California, before settling in Washington State. He graduated from Interlake in 1982, and later pursued a retail career after attending Culinary School.

A devout Christian and Evangelist, Jon had a passion for Christian apologetics, world history, and cultures. He was known for his curiosity about people's backgrounds and his welcoming, joyful nature. He loved books, trucks, and locomotives, and had a deep appreciation for nature and animals. He cherished time with his family and his many passions, always bringing people together with his warmth and conversation. His wit and smile brightened the lives of all who knew him. 

Sadly, Jon is not the only member of family on this page. His brother [Tom Mahoney](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1982/thomas-patrick-tom-mahoney/) died in 2019.

Jon passed away peacefully on August 20, 2024. He was 61 years old.
