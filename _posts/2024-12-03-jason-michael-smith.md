Jason Michael Smith was born in Seattle, raised in Bellevue, came of age at UW(mostly), and left his professional mark in the legal community and real estate. He was a dad, partner, friend, brother, son. These all define steps in Jason’s life path. But they are merely eras of a life that required some grit, good humor, and optimism. They are merely labels and milestones on a timeline. 

More importantly, Jason’s life was marked by the friends he made, family he built, and love, wit and passions he shared with so many. A dedicated Husky, Seahawks, Sonics and Sounders fan, J was always ready to don team colors, watch a game, cheer louder than was reasonable, and direct coaching decisions. To say he could host a party for a big game is an understatement. He elevated a simple mid-season match into a gathering of friends that left all who attended with full bellies and full hearts. 

The legacy of Jason is his heart and community he built around him. He was the bridge builder of friendships with a natural ability to meet and remember even casual acquaintances. But no one was merely a casual acquaintance to Jason. He was a giver; a smile, a handshake, a meal, and of course investing advice. He could recognize and remember everyone he met and when he saw you again, he would fold you into his world with a smile, acknowledging your uniqueness, interests, family. He was a special soul. He lived big, he loved big. 

While the running joke was that Jason loved his dog, Hank, the most, it was his daughter Gabbi that was his greatest joy and pride. Jason was a dad. He didn’t coach her teams or lead her girl scout troop. Instead, he loved, he taught, he shared his passions for music, financial understanding and responsibility. He taught Gabbi about music, to love and appreciate all sorts of genres, to love a great concert and how to make the best playlist. He tangled in political and social justice discussions, teaching Gabbi to be an active citizen with a responsibility to know what’s happening in the world and her smaller community and to participate. He shared his love of food, cooking, and gathering with friends and family. When Gabbi was about eight he started educating her about investing and he didn’t stop until his death. If you knew him, you know his greatest pride was Gabbi. You knew because he told you. He told you how amazing she is, and then he told you again, and maybe again. His love and pride for Gabbi couldn’t be held in, there wasn’t enough space in his heart so he had to let it out. 

Jason did a lot, he lived a lot, he loved a lot, and he left a lot. His death at 51 came far too soon and leaves a gaping hole in the lives of those who knew him, loved him, and got the blessing of being loved by him; his parents, Ron and Marylou Smith, sister Christine Noel and husband Gary, Rachel and Charlie, Steven, Loni, and Nolan. His wife of twenty-two years, Petra, his dog Hank, and most importantly, his daughter Gabrielle. 

Jason passed away on July 21, 2024.
