Holly, aka Holly Goodman Hewitt, worked at the Coal Creek Safeway in Newcastle for twenty-seven years. She will be missed by her co-workers and many loyal customers she could call by name. She was a loving, kind & compassionate friend to them all. Holly's extended family will miss her loving spirit. She was a wonderful mother, daughter, aunt and friend. Holly finished the race the Lord had placed before her, and was greeted in Heaven with, "Well done thou good and faithful servant, thou hast been faithful and just over little, now you will be made ruler over much, enter into the joy of the Lord."

She is survived by her husband of thirty-one years, Glynn Lyle Hewitt of Renton, son Tanner Lyle Hewitt, and daughter Torey Lynne Hewitt.

Holly fought brain cancer for several years before passing away on January 10, 2015. She will be greatly missed.
