Fred “Bud” Locke was a proud veteran of the Army, who served in the Korean War, and who had a long career in Seattle working as a U.S. Customs Agent. In his spare time, he ran marathons (sixteen in all), and through this he wound up coaching cross country at Interlake from the late 90s through the early 2000s. 

Fred Locke passed away peacefully on February 14, 2019. He was 86 years old.

In Fred’s memory, do anything that gets you up and moving today. As he was quoted by a local newspaper in a 2007 interview, “My advice is to get out and enjoy yourself, because life is too short.”
