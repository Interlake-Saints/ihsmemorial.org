Despite suffering from numerous health problems over his later years, Ken never complained and he never asked why me. He lived through two kidney transplants and a pancreas transplant, and he also dealt with many different medical issues because of a life-long battle with diabetes. Ken passed away while holding the hands of his family members on February 14, 2018, and he is no longer in any pain. He was 52 years old.
