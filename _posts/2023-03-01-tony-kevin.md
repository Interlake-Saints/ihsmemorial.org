Tony was diagnosed with stage four colon cancer in August of 2009, despite being only 45 years old, healthy, and having no family history. Yet despite being given only nine months to live, he managed to fight the disease for nearly eleven years. He battled through endless rounds of chemotherapy, and endless surgeries, and multiple other related ancillary procedures, and eventually became known as a story of courage and strength. 

Rather than give in to his illness, instead Tony joined the board of directors of Colon STARS, an organization that brings awareness to the dangers of colon cancer. He eventually become the President of Colon STARS, and also became the CEO of Salire Partners. His career ranged from creating and growing new companies, to managing large sales-logistics teams, all while battling colon cancer for more than a decade. He also served as vice presisdent of Sales for Multiple Zones, as well as a sales and engineering manager for Cisco Systems.

Despite being handed a terrible break of luck in his early forties, Tony lived each day to the fullest, enjoying time with his family and friends. He never let cancer get in his way. He enjoyed traveling, baseball games, and reading on his iPad. In addition to that, he wrote essays on Linkedin about leadership, and how cancer taught him to embrace being a leader. He left behind a legacy for not only his family and friends, but for all the people he touched along the way. According to his family, he was a remarkable man, father, a legend.

Sadly, Tony Kevin passed away in August of 2020.
