Thurman Lee Landers was raised in Richland, WA, and he later became a standout wrestler at Central Washington University in Ellensburg, where he won the NAIA National Championship in 1970. He eventually received his masters degree in physical education, and wound up as a teacher and wrestling coach at Interlake. He coached and taught at Interlake for several years in the mid to late 70s, and was often mentioned by students in the yearbook as being their favorite teacher. Mr. Landers was known for instilling hard work and discipline in his students, reminding everyone under his charge that true champions are made, not born.

After leaving Interlake, Thurman embarked on a long and distinguished career as a teacher, mentor, man of deep faith, coach, and educator. He was particularly well-known in Portland, Oregon, where his family moved in 1989, and he become a role model in his community. His passion for education and Black History made him a notable figure in his children’s schools, where he frequently engaged with students, teaching and mentoring. He coached his son Lee and several of Lee’s friends in wrestling in the late 1990s, leading the team to state championships. Whether he was in the classroom, the wrestling room, or the halls of U.S. Grant High School, Thurman was known as a motivator and father figure for many, always with a smile, a keen sense of humor, and his signature wisdom.

Thurman also had a flair for the unexpected. Among his lesser-known talents was his role as manager of a breakdancing group in Yakima, competing in city and state competitions. He also practiced martial arts, earning a 2nd-degree black belt in Shudokan Karate. Known as Sensei Landers, he taught karate at the Charles Jordan and Peninsula Park Community Centers in Portland. His classes always ended with the motto, “Good, better, best. Never let it rest till the good gets better, and the better gets best.” His students credit his mentorship with guiding them into successful adulthood.

After a long, extraordinary, and distinguished life of service to his community, Thurman passed away peacefully on August 31, 2024, surrounded by his loving family. He was 76 years old.
