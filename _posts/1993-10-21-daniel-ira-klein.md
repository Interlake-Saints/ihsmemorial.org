Daniel died after a motorcycle crash on October 21, 1993. He suffered head trauma when his motorcycle hit a rock and crashed on the SR 520 Eastbound just before the 148th Ave NE exit in Bellevue. In his honor, Evergreen State College in Olympia now hands out the Daniel Ira Klein Memorial Scholarship every year in the field of communications.
