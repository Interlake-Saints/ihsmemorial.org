Tony was a national caliber athlete, having won the 1978 NJCAA Wrestling Championship, and he studied at the University of Washington on a wrestling scholarship. After college, he coached wrestling at IHS for sixteen years, where he was a tough but supportive mentor. Tony died unexpectedly on July 25, 2015, while mountain biking in Central Washington.

Sadly, Tony's brother, [Doug](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1975/homer-douglas-burrows/), is also listed on the IHS Memorial Page. He is listed under the Class of 1975.
