Sharon was known for her big blonde hair, her love for music and dancing, and her competitiveness, especially on family board game night. She was also incredibly athletic, and was known to pull off a no-handed cartwheel on a moment's notice, often without warning. She was a beautiful bright light in the world, and she always tried to lift up those around her, despite her own struggles. She was a particularly big fan of the Seahawks, and of rewatching her favorite old 80s and 90s movies.

Sadly, Sharon and her unique spirit passed away in April of 2024. She was 46 years old.
