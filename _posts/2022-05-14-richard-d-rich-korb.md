Rich was full of life and energy and ambition. He was a teacher and administrator for thirty-five years. He also had several side businesses, and wrote several books. In 2013, as a reward for retiring, he rode his bike 1,860 miles on a dream trip, all the way from Washington State to Wisconsin. 

Rich was a strong believer in Jesus, and his salutation on his emails was always "following the Shepherd home." Sadly, he passed away on October 28, 2020, after a short valiant fight with brain cancer.  He leaves behind his wife of forty-five years, Jennie, as well as three children and seven grandchildren.
