Wendy was the registrar at Interlake, and she was also a key member in the grass roots development of the Interlake High School Booster Club. She was always an enthusiastic volunteer, and she always encouraged the involvement and success of our athletes. Sadly, she passed away on January 10, 2001, after a three and a half year battle against ovarian cancer.

In Wendy's honor, a $1,000 scholarship is now given away each year to one outstanding IHS scholar-athlete.
