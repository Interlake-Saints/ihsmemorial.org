At Interlake, John was involved in soccer, football, and the DeMolay International youth organization. He graduated from IHS in 1982, and then joined the Army National Guard. But he always credited DeMolay for giving him the leadership and skills to later run his own landscaping company. He married his wife, LaVonne, in 1997, and six years later their son Jevon was born.

In his spare time John enjoyed cooking, metal detecting, swimming, watching the History and Discovery Channels, and the Philadelphia Eagles. John loved Christmas and the family tradition of making pierogies.

Sadly, John passed away on October 13th, 2021 in Seattle, after a three year battle with diabetes. He was 57 years old.

Heaven is a funnier place now that John has arrived.
