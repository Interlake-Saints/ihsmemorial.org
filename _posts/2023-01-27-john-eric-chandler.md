John was a man who lived a full life, and lived it on his own terms. He rode motorcycles and raised ostriches. He worked as a machinist. He was a mountain man and a bit intimidating to look at, even in high school, but was always a great guy. Sadly, he passed away on Friday, November 4th, 2022. 

John is survived by his wife Nancy, his daughters Jenefur and Kea, his brothers David, Michael, and Stephan, and his sisters Connie and Rita.
