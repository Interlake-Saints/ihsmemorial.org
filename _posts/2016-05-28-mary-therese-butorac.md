Teri, aka Teri McMillen and Teri Ferren, worked at Alaska Airlines for more than 30 years, until illness forced her into retirement in 2010. Living on Whidbey Island, she fought a long, courageous battle against ovarian cancer for over five years, until she passed away on May 28, 2016. She was 62 years old.
