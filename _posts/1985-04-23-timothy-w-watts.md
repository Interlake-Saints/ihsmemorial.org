Tim Watts never complained. He never asked ''why me'' or felt sorry for himself. He never quit. But on April 23, 1985, his two-and-a-half-year battle with cancer ended. The former Interlake High School student died from leukemia at his parents home in Bellevue. He was only 18 years old.\
\
Although his illness kept him from attending school for part of his junior and all of his senior year, Tim was a 4.0 student and only two classes away from graduation.\
\
''He was a tremendous student and a super person,'' said Interlake science teacher, Jerry Akita, who taught Tim chemistry and biology. ''He would miss two and three weeks of school at a time because of his illness,'' Akita said. ''But he would always come back to class caught up. I couldn't believe his tenacity. Most people in his position, including myself, would have hung it up. Not Tim, he never quit doing his best.''
