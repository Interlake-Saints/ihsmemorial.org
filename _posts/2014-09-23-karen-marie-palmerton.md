Heaven gained another angel on September 23, 2014 in Karen, aka Karen Marie Conley, after she passed away of complications following open heart surgery. She was 49 years old. Karen was a loving wife, daughter, sister, aunt and friend. To say that she will be missed is an understatement. She was a light in this world and she lived her life for God through faith, hope and love. Everything she did, she did out of love.
