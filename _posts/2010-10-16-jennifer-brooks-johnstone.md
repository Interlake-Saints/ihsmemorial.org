Jenny died unexpectedly in Scottsdale, AZ on October 16, 2010. She was a therapist, and she was counseling a depressed friend of hers who had come to visit her in Arizona. In an attempt to get him over his troubles, the two of them went out drinking. Later, when Jenny went to sleep, the alcohol interacted with a medication she had been taking, and she simply never woke up. It was ruled an accident.

Jenny was 36 years old.
