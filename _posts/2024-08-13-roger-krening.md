Roger was only at Interlake for a short period of time - he was a P.E. teacher and football coach in the late 70s - but he later had a very prominent career in the Cle Elum School District. In Cle Elum, he taught elementary, middle, and high school PE, coached three sports, and served as the longtime district athletic director. 

During his thirty year career as a teacher and administrator, Roger received numerous awards. In fact, he was eventually inducted into three different Athletic Halls of Fame - at Chadron State University in 1998, Cle Elum High School in 1991, and Ellensburg High School in 2018. 

While his career accomplishments were many, Roger will best be remembered for his genuine care and support for other people. His servant attitude and sincere interest in others set him apart, and left an overwhelmingly positive mark on the world and the people who knew him.

Roger passed away on July 16, 2023 in Ellensburg. He was 86 years old.
