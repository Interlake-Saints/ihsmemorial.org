Mike grew up playing basketball on the mean streets of Bellevue, and he spent summers biking perilously down the hills of Lopez Island. Although he attended two years of Interlake with his childhood friends, he actually graduated from Eastside Catholic in 1983. He then went on to graduate from the University of Washington, where he was a member of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity.

Among other things, Mike was known as a podcaster and a social commentator. You can still find many of his old podcasts online. 

Sadly, Mike died on November 13, 2021, in Austin, Texas after a brief, unexpected illness. He was 56 years old.
