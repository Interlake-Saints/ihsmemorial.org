Linda, also known as Linda Bliss Meagher, or Linda Bliss Wiedmaeier, died of complications of multiple diseases on October 29, 2021.

Sadly, Linda isnâ€™t the only member of her family on the IHS Memorial Wall. Her older brother [Kevin](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1974/kevin-malcolm-bliss/), and her sisters [Carol](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1981/carol-christine-bliss/) and [Mary](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1982/mary-bliss/) also have entries on the page. All four were born with the same rare genetic condition, and they all died young.
