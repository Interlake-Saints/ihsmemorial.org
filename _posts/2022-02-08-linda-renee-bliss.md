Linda, also known as Linda Bliss Meagher, or Linda Bliss Wiedmaeier, died of complications of multiple diseases on October 29, 2021. 

Sadly, Linda passed away right after her sister Carol, who had died of a stroke just four months earlier. Carol [is also listed on the IHS Memorial Wall](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1981/carol-christine-bliss/).
