Amanda, aka Amanda Michelle Harding, aka "Amy" to those who knew and loved her, died on June 9, 2025, of complications from Lupus. She was 48 years old.

Amy was born in Murray, Utah on July 11, 1976. In 1989 her family moved to Bellevue. She graduated from Interlake in 1995 and went on to earn an associate’s degree in Fashion Marketing from Seattle Art Institute. Her real passion, though, was caring for people - both young and old - so she later earned her Medical Assistant’s degree. She worked at Group Health in Bellevue before returning to Utah where she worked at Intermountain Healthcare with her close friend, Dr. Mark Lee.

Upon her return to Utah Amy met the love of her life, Ryan Harding. Ryan brought two children to their marriage which gave Amy great joy. She loved being a mother, and was elated when Shaylee asked if she would adopt her. Amy loved children and they loved her. She cared for different children throughout her life and kept in touch with many of them. She loved animals and they loved her, she had her own little backyard menagerie that included goats, duck, chickens, and kitties. Her passion for flamingos was her trademark, however. If they could live in Utah’s climate, she surely would have had one.

Amy is survived by her loving husband Ryan Harding, her daughter Shaylee Harding, her parents Steven and Becky Anderson, her grandparents Verla Mortensen and Richard & Mildred Anderson, her brother Brad Anderson (Erika), her stepbrother Jared Anderson, her stepsister Julie Gedge (Kelsey), her little man Hunter Anderson, many aunts, uncles, cousins, and children who called her auntie. She is preceded in death by her grandfather Sonny Mortensen and her cousin Tyler Thornton.

Amy, you will be missed by all who knew and loved you.
