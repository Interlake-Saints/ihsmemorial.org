Ray was a star athlete at Interlake in the late 60's/early 70's, and for more than 25 years he held the Kingco Conference career football scoring record. He passed away on February 25, 2013 of complications following a heart attack.

Ray was immensely popular while he was in high school, both for his athletic prowess, as well as his humble, kind nature. To see an example of this, check out the slew of comments (below) that were left by his friends.
