T﻿homas was a sophomore in pre-law at the University of Washington when he died in a tragic accident the night of May 15, 1986. He fell out of a third-floor window at the UW Alpha Delta Phi fraternity house.

Thomas was a known sleepwalker, and he was not legally drunk at the time, so police eventually classified the incident as a sleepwalking accident. Thomas was only 19 years old.

A﻿ scholarship was later opened in his name through the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity.
