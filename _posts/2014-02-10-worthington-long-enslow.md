Worthington should have been class of 1973, but he wound up graduating in 1974 because he missed a lot of school due to back surgery. Sadly, he passed away on February 10, 2014, of a cerebral aneurysm, brought on by high blood pressure and heart disease. It was the coroner's finding that he died in his sleep, painlessly.
