Hilton was a standout athlete at Interlake, who was not only named "most athletic" in the yearbook, he was also the MVP of the basketball team, and was named "most inspirational member" of the football team. Even though he was short in stature, he thrilled people with his amazing athletic abilities, his ability as a teammate, and his speed.

What really set Hilton apart from his peers, however, was his kindness towards others. According to one of his friends, "Hilton had an infectious laugh, a winsome smile, and a magnetic personality. When I was a kid watching Interlake sports, there was no other person that I wanted to transform into other than Hilton Mitchell. His athletic abilities were unquestioned, but what made Hilton truly special was his ability to recognize and reach people. No person was hidden to Hilton. He greeted each person in the hallway as if they mattered. He was the most popular kid in our high school, but he did not use his platform for his own glory, but for the betterment of others. It is a unique quality to be able to give and deflect your glory to others, but that is what Hilton demonstrated."

After high school, Hilton eventually moved to Oregon, where he worked at Nike World Headquarters for more than twenty years. He was a fixture on the Nike campus, where everyone who knew him knew he was one of the kindest people on the face of the earth. He left his mark on thousands, either through work, through coaching, through his work at the Boys and Girls Club, or through the church. He was a hard worker, an excellent teammate, and a great friend. No matter what was going on in his life, he would always greet you with a smile and treat you with the upmost respect.

Sadly, Hilton Mitchell passed away unexpectedly in his sleep on July 26, 2022. He was 61 years old.
