Traci was raised in New Mexico by her grandparents, and then moved to Bellevue at age 14, where she stayed with her sisters, as well as various families in foster care. She eventually found a permanent home in Bellevue with the Wick family. She only attended Interlake for her freshman year, before transferring to Redmond High School for her final three years. In high school, she was active in dance and cheerleading. She eventually wound up in competitive cheer for the Connect Cheer team, where she was an avid stunter and flyer. 

At the time of her death, Traci was attending Bellevue College, pursuing a degree in business in hopes of working in real-estate and interior design. She had a natural talent for decor and fashionable style. Those that knew her admired her keen eye for elegant aesthetics and often sought her advice for clothes and design. While attending college, Traci also worked as a nanny. She established a loving and caring relationship with several families and children.

Traci was remarkably outgoing, strong-willed, smart, and funny; her infectious smile and unique personality lit up every room. She loved to travel. She loved to try new things, and picked up several hobbies over the years, including sewing, snowboarding, ukulele, baking, and travel vlogging. She loved the beauty of nature, and loved to go camping with her sister.

Sadly, on Sunday, June 13th, 2021, the beautiful and young Traci Grace Carson passed away suddenly and unexpectedly, and left all our hearts heavy with the immense void she has left. Though Traciâ€™s time on Earth has come to an end, her light and memories live on in her friends, family, and fur-baby Koya. Her next journey has just begun.
