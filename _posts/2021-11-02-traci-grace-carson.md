Early on Sunday, June 13th, 2021, the beautiful and young Traci Grace Carson passed away suddenly and unexpectedly, and left all our hearts heavy with the immense void she has left.

Traci was born on March 1st, 1999 in Federal Way, Washington to her mother Rieko Sone and estranged father. She was the youngest of their children, having three older sisters - Emi Stuart, Tiano Carson, and Tisa Carson.

She spent half of her preschool days in Washington and, after being adopted by her grandparents Jerry Wayne Carson Sr. and the late Christine Grace Carson, she moved to Albuquerque, NM. Traci and her grandmother adored each other, and it was through her that Traci discovered her love of cooking and fashion.

In Albuquerque she attended Double Eagle Elementary School, Desert Ridge Middle School, and Eisenhower Middle School. She loved to spend her time outdoors with her sisters, riding bikes through the desert, putting on plays and fashion shows, and pretending to be the Cheetah girls singing in the backyard. She attended Baptist church every Sunday, participated in gymnastics, and competed in science and robotics program competitions.

At the age of 14, Traci made the move back to Washington state, this time residing in Bellevue, Washington. Upon moving back to WA, she lived with her sisters and various families in foster care and eventually found a home with the Wick family. She attended Interlake High School for her freshman year, and Redmond High School for sophomore, junior, and senior year, eventually graduating from RHS in 2017. While attending Redmond High School, she discovered her appreciation for dance and cheerleading and became a varsity cheerleader for her school. Traci simultaneously honed her skills in competitive cheer and decided to join the Connect Cheer team where she was an avid stunter and flyer. She was remarkably outgoing, strong-willed, smart, and funny; her infectious smile and unique personality lit up every room.

At the age of 18, she wanted to try something new and decided to attend her freshman year of college at the University of Montana. There she enrolled as a bio-chem major and joined the sorority Alpha Phi. She loved the nature she was surrounded by, and frequently drove through the mountains with her friends in her free time. After a year at UM she discovered she wasn’t passionate about her degree and decided to leave Missoula to pursue other goals back in Washington State. She attended Bellevue College instead, pursuing a degree in business in hopes of using her degree in real-estate and interior design. While attending school, Traci worked as a nanny; establishing a loving and caring relationship with several families and children.

In the last years of Traci’s life on earth, she made huge plans because of her great drive to discover her passions and to find what made her happy. She loved to travel - having been to many places in her young life from Mexico, Hawaii, Europe and several others in between. Before her passing, Traci had plans to travel around the world and try all the unique street food she saw on YouTube. She also loved the beauty of nature and was excited whenever she could go camping or on off-road adventures with her sister. She loved to try new things and picked up several hobbies over the years, including sewing, snowboarding, ukulele, baking, and travel vlogging. Traci also had a natural talent for decor and fashionable style. Those that knew her admired her keen eye for elegant aesthetics and often sought her advice for clothes and design.

Though Traci’s time on Earth has come to an end, her light and memories live on in her friends, family, and fur-baby Koya. Her next journey has just begun.
