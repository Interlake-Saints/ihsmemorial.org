Terry suffered a heart attack at the age of 30, on August 13, 1997, and he died in the hospital five days later, on August 18, 1997. He was a law student at Portland's Northwestern School of Law at Lewis & Clark College at the time. In his honor, his friends later constructed the [Terry Riley Bridge](https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Terry_Riley_Bridge) in Portland's Tryon Creek State Natural Area, which stands in his memory.
