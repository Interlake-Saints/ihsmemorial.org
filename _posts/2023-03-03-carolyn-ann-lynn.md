Carolyn, aka Carolyn Lynn Gough, graduated from Interlake in 1977, and earned a two-year degree from Bellevue Community College. She married Ronald William "Bill" Gough on March 10, 1989, in the Seattle temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

In addition to being a homemaker, Carolyn worked in accounting at Benson and McGloughlin, and REI. She loved knitting, quilting, flower arranging, gardening, soap and candle making, stamping, card making and rug hooking. She was a member of local rose and dahlia societies, and was also a well known member of the craft society Art 'n Soul. She was kind, thoughtful, witty, and was unflappable while helping customers during all types of recycled craft fairs. Her friends, family, and craft partners are going to miss her dearly.

Sadly, Carolyn passed away in Centralia on August 11, 2022, due to complications of ovarian cancer. She is survived by her husband, Bill Gough; step-son Steven William Gough; step-daughters Anna Julene Woodruff and Laura Cathleen Gallagher; eight step-grandchildren; and one brother, Alan Lynn. She was predeceased by her parents.

If you would like to make a donation on her behalf, Bill suggested any cancer organization of your choice.
