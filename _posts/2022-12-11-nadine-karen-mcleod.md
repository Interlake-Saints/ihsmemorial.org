Nadine, aka Nadine McLeod Ferris, moved to Indiana after high school, and later graduated from Indiana University with a degree in nursing. She then spent over thirty years as a nurse, with her career spanning from pediatrics to surgery recovery to home healthcare to senior living. She retired from nursing in 2017, and retirement provided more time for three of her favorite things: coffee, chocolate and Candy Crush. She also enjoyed cheering on the Colts.

On top of her nursing career, Nadine also owned and operated a home landscaping nursery business with her husband of thirty-two years, Dave. They lived in Coatsville, Indiana, before later settling for good and building a life together with their children in Greencastle.

From line dancing with her daughter, to attending sporting events for her grandsons, Nadine was always up for making memories with her family. They truly were her pride and joy. She was also a lover of all animals, especially dogs. She rescued several fur babies in her lifetime, and always provided them with a wonderful home. Her sassy attitude and caring demeanor will be greatly missed by all who love her. She was a strong, independent woman, and fiercely protective of those she loved.

Nadine left this earth peacefully on Wednesday, October 26, 2022, after a battle with cancer. She was 70 years old.
