Friso (who some people knew as Cisco) died of cystic fibrosis during his senior year of high school, on October 8, 1978. In his honor, a tree was planted in the memorial garden with his name on it. He also got a special memorial page in the 1979 IHS yearbook, which is posted below.

Friso was incredibly loved by a great number of his classmates, and he was the single most requested entry when I first started to put together this website.
