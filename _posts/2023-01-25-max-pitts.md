Max graduated from Interlake in 2018, and he enrolled at Washington State University in the AMDT (Apparel, Merchandising, Design, and Textiles) program. He LOVED fashion, and he planned to major in AMDT with an emphasis in merchandising. Sadly, Max never reached that goal because he committed suicide on November 11, 2022. He was only 21 years old.

In Max's memory, his parents have opened the Max Pitts Memorial AMDT Endowed Scholarship. It is open to all AMDT students at Washington State University, and if you wish to contribute to the scholarship, the link is [here](https://foundation.wsu.edu/give/?fund=1afcba6b-7515-4263-a0c9-70614bf09109&cat=idonate_colleges&area=idonate_agricultural_human_and_natural_resource_sciences&utm_campaign=max-pitts-memorial-amdt-endowed-scholarship&fbclid=IwAR2viJYw4iEh52aDhdsDhpTIPqeBiGs0lx-s60PNrInaBZbf-sPbImZE580).

In the words of his mother, "This has shaken our world and we are still trying to make sense of it. So many people have reached out and offered love and condolences, and we appreciate every single one of you. So many have asked "What can I do for you?" If you are able, Paris and I ask that you donate any amount, large or small, to this scholarship in remembrance of Max. Please fill out the "in memory of" section so we can send you a thank you. The scholarship is a 501c3 endowment under the WSU Foundation, so it's also tax deductible.  Please feel free to share this post. Thank you from both of us."
