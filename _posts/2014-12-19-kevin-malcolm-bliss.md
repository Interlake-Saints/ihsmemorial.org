Kevin died in Arizona on December 19, 2014. He was 59 years old.

Unfortunately, Kevin isnâ€™t the only member of his family on the IHS Memorial Wall. His younger sisters [Linda](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1979/linda-renee-bliss/), [Carol](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1981/carol-christine-bliss/), and [Mary](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1982/mary-bliss/) also have entries on the page. All four were born with the same rare genetic condition, and they all died young.
