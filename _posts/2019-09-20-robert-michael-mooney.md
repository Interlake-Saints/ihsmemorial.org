At Interlake, Bob was a proud member of the "Brewskis." Later in life, he came to be regarded as one of the most successful tenant rep brokers in the Seattle area. Over a career spanning thirty-five years, he established the region's preeminent life sciences real estate practice. He was also an avid outdoorsman. He summited volcanoes, explored the ocean floor, shredded the finest powder on Earth, attacked world class single track mountain bike terrain, pulled trout from almost every creek and river in the Pacific Northwest, and was never skunked on a hunting expedition. In January 2019, Bob was diagnosed with Glioblastoma Multiforme. He faced his terminal illness with bravery and grace. Not once did he display anger or resentment, rather he embraced his diagnosis as a last lesson to his sons. He was determined to live each day to the fullest, open his heart, and accept the love and support flooding his way. Sadly, Bob passed away on September 20th, 2019, at his home, surrounded by loved ones. He was 58 years old.
