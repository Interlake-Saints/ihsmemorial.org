Sally was a beloved home economics teacher at Interlake from the early 70's up until the early 90's. She passed away peacefully with her family by her side on January 31, 2011, after an unexpected medical emergency.

You can see the love for Sally from the two pages of comments that were left by her former students below. She really made a difference in a lot of kids' lives.
