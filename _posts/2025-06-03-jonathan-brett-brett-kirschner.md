Jonathan “Brett” Kirschner was born on July 3, 1991, in Bellevue, Washington. He graduated from Interlake in 2010 and went on to play football at the University of Montana. Sports were a major part of his life. He was involved in football, baseball, and track, and received many awards and accolades over the years for his achievements. Brett was passionate about everything he did and always gave 110%. He was a member of the Bellevue Church of the Nazarene and attended there since his birth.

Brett was a gentle, compassionate young man who centered his faith and family in everything he pursued. He embodied a spirit of service – always looking after and sticking up for those he noticed needed help or were less fortunate. Along with being an avid athlete, Brett loved music, dancing, vintage clothing, sneakers, designing clothing, Dick’s burgers, and spending time with family and friends. He will be fondly remembered for his quick wit, his contagious smile, and his unconditional kindness.

Sadly, Brett passed away unexpectedly on April 26, 2025. He was 33 years old.

We are grateful for the time we had with Brett. His passing has left a void in the hearts of family, friends, and those who had the opportunity to meet him. May his memory be a reminder to continue his compassion toward others.
