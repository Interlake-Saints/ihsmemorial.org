Matt was an elite athlete at Interlake, he was a star player on the football, basketball, and baseball teams. He was so good at baseball that he was actually drafted by the Houston Astros in the 1990 Major League Baseball draft. But a car accident on March 21, 1991, changed the course of his life. Matt was in a car with friend and fellow 1990 IHS grad [Matthew Foster](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1990/matthew-ryan-foster/) when it crashed in Seattle. Foster was killed, while Lustyk was left seriously injured, with a major brain injury. One tragedy changed the lives of two promising young athletes, in the blink of an eye.

Matt Lustyk lived for thirty more years before he sadly passed away on July 21, 2021. He was 48 years old.
