Aaron grew up in the Redmond area, attending Horace Mann Elementary and Redmond Junior High before attending and graduating from Interlake. As a boy, he enjoyed baseball, soccer, Boy Scouts, and Civil Air Patrol - he even made it to Philmont as a scout. His love of planes began early and never faded.

Aaron worked primarily at Safeway and Albertson's in Produce, the Deli, and as a cashier. He took pride in his work and he valued his customers. His coworkers have shared how he brought humor and warmth to the workplace with his jokes and helpful spirit. He persevered through the Covid years, knowing that his job was important.

Aaron also had a playful side - he loved pranks and making people laugh. He was mechanically inclined from a young age, once taking apart the family vacuum cleaner just to see how it worked. That curiosity stayed with him throughout his life, whether he was building LEGO Technic sets or assembling model planes and vehicles. The next time you see or hear an airplane, we hope you'll think of Aaron - and smile.

Aaron passed away at his family's home in Vancouver (WA) on March 26, 2025. He was 41 years old.
