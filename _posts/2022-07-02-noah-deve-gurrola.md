On the morning of May 28, 2022, Noah was driving his mom's 2006 Toyota Scion from his house to a fishing tournament. He was headed east on I-90 when he accidentally drove off the road just outside Cle Elum. His car went about fifty yards before veering left, rolling, and striking a tree. Noah died at the scene. He was only twenty years old.

Noah was known as funny, goofy, hilarious, intelligent, polite, kind, gentle, a hard worker, a good son, a good brother, a good cousin, a good friend, a good cook, good with impersonations, a lover of nature and the outdoors, and a GREAT fisherman. He was loving, lovable, and so loved. Some friends and cousins will greet him in heaven. They are probably already fishing, hanging out, and laughing together.
