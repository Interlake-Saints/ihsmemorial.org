Diane, aka Diane Marie Bradbury, grew up in California but transferred to Interlake for her junior and senior years. As a child she was an active water skier, and was heavily involved in water ski slalom and jumping events.

After high school, she worked at JH Baxter in Issaquah as an administrative bookkeeper. In 1980 she was employed by Sperry, Unisys in the service parts department. This was her favorite part of her working life. She later worked as a self-employed medical transcriptionist, and at the Mount Si Senior Center in North Bend as a transportation clerk. This wound up being one of her favorite places as, even after her working years, she continued volunteering at the Center Thrift Shop. She loved being involved with valley seniors. 

Diane married her husband Graeme in 1983, and they were together for thirty-six years. In her adult life she liked playing softball and pool for Bellevue leagues, and was also involved with square and country dancing, crocheting, and arts and crafts. 

Diane will be greatly missed by all of those whose lives she touched. She will be remembered most of all for her warm loving smile, her caring disposition, and her beautiful red hair. Diane and Graeme will forever be a loving and devoted couple. 

Diane died unexpectedly on Friday, November 1, 2019. She was 65 years old.
