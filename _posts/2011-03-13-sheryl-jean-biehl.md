Sheri, aka Sheri Jean Biehl Pardi, passed away on March 13, 2011. She was 46 years old. She had had a liver transplant in 2009, and in March of 2011 her body and the liver stopped working together. She was a tireless Redmond school volunteer, as well as a longtime volunteer for Redmond West Little League.

Sadly, Sheri is not the only member of her family on the IHS Memorial Wall. Her older sister, [Barbie](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1977/barbara-biehl/), is listed under the Class of 1977.
