Vicki, aka Vicki Lynn Matthews, was born in Yakima in 1956. She was the middle of three children of James and Dorothy Wharton. Her family moved to Spokane where she spent her early childhood, and then relocated to Bellevue for her high school years.

Vicki was a lively child. She had lots of energy and was always on the move, traits she was known for throughout her life. In her youth Vicki could be found on the tennis courts, playing tetherball, bowling, softball, or cheerleading. She graduated from Interlake in 1974. She was a member of the drill team and was crowned homecoming princess her senior year. It was also where she met her high school sweetheart, Larry. They later married, had two children, Greg and Sandra, and shared 47 years together.

Vicki's compassionate heart and love of health led her to a career in nursing. She was an instructor for the Childbirth Education Association, worked at St. Vincent nursing home, and spent time at both Fallbrook and Overlake Hospital as an OB nurse. She eventually joined Virginia Mason where she stayed most of her career, working in a variety of departments: family practice, OBGYN, and gastroenterology. Vicki officially retired from Virginia Mason in 2019.

Generous with her time and serving others was a lifelong passion for Vicki and she excelled at it. A dedicated member of the Lake Washington Christian Church for over 35 years, she served as a deacon, elder, preschool teacher, and was on the pastoral care committee. Outside of church she volunteered at Children's Hospital, Hopelink, and most recently as a puppy raiser for Canine Companions for Independence. She raised five puppies for the organization, and it was a role she was most proud of. She said, "Next to having kids, being a puppy raiser for CCI was the best thing I ever did".

Vicki's spirit was bright. She was known for her beautiful smile, and joyful nature. "Walking sunshine" was a phrase that aptly described Vicki. Always playful, everyone's cheerleader, and certainly an optimist. She extended kindness to everyone in her path, both people and animals were drawn to her energy. She valued her faith, family, friends, and serving others. Her mornings would often start in her "prayer chair", and end with an entry in her "joy journal". Her best days were simple, spent in the presence of those she loved, serving others, and walking the neighborhood with a dog or two in tow.

Our beloved Vicki passed away peacefully in the presence of family on March 10, 2024. She was 67 years old.
