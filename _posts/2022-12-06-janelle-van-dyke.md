Janelle, who was also known as Janelle Van Dyke-Roberts and Janelle Roberts Healy, was a strong passionate mother of three, grandmother of three, and keeper of many. She lived her life one day at a time, enjoying what was in front of her, and flipping off those in the rear view. No time to wait when the plates were full and there were memories to be made, especially with family. 

Sï»¿he worked for many years as an office assistant and an office manager in the world of real estate, most notably for Windermere Real Estate and Sotheby's.

Janelle struggled with lung cancer before passing away on June 24, 2022.

May her memory follow all those who she loved, and even moreso those who got in the way!
