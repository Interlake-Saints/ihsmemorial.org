Diane, aka Diane Friedenbach Juenger, passed away on June 25, 2020, after a year long battle with cancer. As her husband Tom put it so beautifully, Diane was the the world's best mom, a great friend to many in times of need, an incredible fighter, and the walking personification of sunshine, even while she fought the disease that was viciously attacking her from within. Diane dedicated her life to helping others while passionately loving her family and friends. She was 49 years old.
