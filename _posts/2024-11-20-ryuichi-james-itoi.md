Ryuichi James Itoi, a beloved member of our community, passed away peacefully at home on December 23, 2022, after a courageous battle with addiction. Originally from Korea, he spent the first several years of his life in an orphanage before he was adopted by James and Yumiko Weed and brought to Seattle. He later graduated with honors from Interlake High School's Transition Program in 2006.

Ryuichi spent the next several years attending University of Washington and Bellevue College, and eventually earned his Associates in Anthropology and a certificate in JavaScript in 2013. 

Ryuichi will be remembered for his passion for fashion and his dedication to the LGBTQ Community Theatre in King County. In lieu of flowers, donations in Ryuichi's memory can be made to The Michael Leonardi Foundation for Fentanyl Awareness.

Ryuichi was 36 years old.
