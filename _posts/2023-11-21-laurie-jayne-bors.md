Laurie, aka Laurie Bors-Aves, attended Highline Community College after graduating Interlake. She then embarked on a career as an interior designer.

She married her husband Morrie Aves in 1979 and, over the next twenty-six years, they embarked on many adventures together. They built their waterfront dream home on Puget Sound. They lived abroad in England for a while. They traveled together all throughout Europe. All the while cultivating their shared love of antiques, auctions, good food, and wine. In the 2000s, they eventually set roots down and moved to the historic town of Florence, Colorado.

Laurie became well-known in Florence over the years because of her store, The Mezzanine Antiques and Collectibles. She and Morrie also became very involved the local tight-knit Florence business community, as they made every effort they could to improve the small town that they loved so very much. Sadly, Morrie passed away in February of 2022, leaving Laurie as a widow.

Unfortunately, Laurie did not have much time to enjoy life on her own, as she died a little more than a year later. She was on a sightseeing trip with other members of the local Florence business community on May 6, 2023, when their small plane crashed in the mountains of Colorado. She was 66 years old.
