Babs, aka Babette Aline Kratz, was born in Seattle on July 8th, 1955, and was the oldest of two children. She graduated from Interlake in 1973, and went on to study mathematics at the University of Washington.

Babs had five children in her lifetime, two of which died prematurely. This loss of two children drove her to attend nursing school at Bellevue Community College. She then went on to care for infants at Seattle Children's Hospital. She spent thirteen years at Seattle Children's Hospital overall, and later spent time working for Harborview Medical Center, as well as time spent as a travel nurse. She eventually retired from nursing in 2018.

Babs died at home, peacefully in her sleep with her husband and daughter nearby, on May 8, 2024. She was 68 years old.

Sadly, Babs is not the only member of her family listed on this page. Her younger sister, [Camille Menard Martlin](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1980/camille-lynette-cami-menard/), and her nephew, [Max Martlin](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-2017/max-hunter-martlin/), died in a car accident in 2021.
