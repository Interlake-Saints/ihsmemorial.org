Loren worked as an underwriting specialist for Safeco for many years. He found the ultimate peace on February 12, 2009, due to unexpected heart failure.

Sadly, his sister, [Terri](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1976/teresa-louise-james/), is also listed on the IHS Memorial Wall, under the Class of 1976.
