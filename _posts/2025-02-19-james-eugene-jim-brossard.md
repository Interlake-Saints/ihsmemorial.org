Jim graduated from Interlake in 1975 and earned a Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Seattle University. He then built a long and distinguished career as an engineer, most recently serving as a Senior Systems Engineer at Milgard Windows and Doors. Previously, he contributed his expertise to Quinton Inc. as a Design and Manufacturing Engineer, and to Totem Ocean Trailer Express as a Systems Engineer. Known for his problem-solving skills, Jim was always ready to lend a hand- whether fixing a car, building something new, or helping his family reconnect to the internet.

In recent years, Jim embraced cycling with enthusiasm. He completed rides such as the STP (Seattle to Portland), Steamboat Gravel, and Reach the Beach. He also enjoyed indoor virtual bike rides with his brothers, and he led rides for the Cascade Bicycle Club. His passion for cycling and life was infectious, inspiring those around him with his curiosity and excitement.

Jim passed away peacefully on January 8, 2025, in Kirkland, Washington. He was 68 years old.

His warmth, ingenuity, and zest will be deeply missed by all who knew him.
