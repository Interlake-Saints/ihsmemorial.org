Rosanne, aka Rosanne Agoado Eskenazi, married her IHS high school sweetheart, Maury, and they stayed together for forty-two years, eventually having two children. She had a passion for books and was an ardent reader. She loved her dogs, The Beatles, and her family. She spent thirty-five years at Boeing as a software analyst, before retiring in 2014.

Unfortunately, Rosanne caught Covid at the start of 2020, and she had to be on a ventilator for two weeks. As she was battling back to normalcy afterwards, she suffered a stroke, and wound up requiring therapy and, eventually, in-home care. She was a fighter though, and she fought through it the best that she could, often before many of the current treatments were available. 

Sadly, Rosanne passed away on Friday, July 29, 2022 at her home in Kirkland. She was 65 years old.
