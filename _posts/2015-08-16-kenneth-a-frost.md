Ken passed away on August 16, 2015 in Los Angeles.

Sadly, Ken isn't the only member of the Frost family on the IHS Memorial Wall. His older brothers [Karl](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1969/karl-albert-frost/) and [Paul](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1971/paul-dale-frost/) also have memorial entries.
