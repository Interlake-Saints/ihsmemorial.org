Stephanie, who was also known as Stephanie Holttum, was a uniquely talented artist who was well known in the local art community. She passed away on November 28, 2015 after a long battle with brain cancer.

Sadly, Stephanie is not the only member of her family to be listed on the IHS Memorial Wall. Her brother [Sean](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1979/sean-michael-stanelun/) is also listed here, under the Class of 1979.
