Barry was the third of eight siblings. He was born in Seattle, and he spent most of his life in the Seattle area- graduating from Interlake in 1973, and later studying at Lake Washington Institute of Technology (LWTech), and also Bellevue Community College. For a good deal of his life, he worked in real estate and condominium property management.

Sadly, Barry passed away on January 18, 2024, from complications of a stroke. He was preceded in death by his parents, and he will be missed by everyone who knew him.
