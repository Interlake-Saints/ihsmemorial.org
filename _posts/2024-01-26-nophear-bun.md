Nophear was a kind-hearted, open-armed person, who had recently started a career as a DJ. She was a social butterfly, and anytime she went out she would make sure everyone was included and being heard. She was at her best when performing her music (under her DJ name "Nono") at small venues. She loved music, cars, and bringing smiles. She was also an amazing big sister, cousin, friend, and daughter.

Despite its tragically short duration, Nophear's life was a beacon of love and compassion that shone brightly. In her twenty-three years, she touched the hearts of many around her, fostering connections that will endure beyond her untimely departure. Her radiant spirit and enduring fortitude will forever be remembered by those she held dear.

Survived by her loving mother, Noeun Yim, Nophear's absence leaves a void that cannot be filled. Her legacy of love and resilience will continue to live on in the hearts of all who knew and cherished her.

Nophear passed away unexpectedly on November 13, 2023. She was 23 years old.
