Michelle graduated from the special education program at Interlake, and she was an active participant in the local Bellevue parks programs for years. She worked at the Factoria McDonald's for nearly two decades and later worked for Goodwill, before retiring in 2018. She also participated in the Special Olympics in both bowling and track and field, and won several medals, including a gold medal for the 400-yard dash. Michelle never knew a stranger. She loved all she met. She had an incredible memory for names and dates.

Sadly, Michelle passed away on February 16, 2020, in Bellevue. She was 50 years old.
