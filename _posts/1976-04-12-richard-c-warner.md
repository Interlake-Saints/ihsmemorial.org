Dick Warner was a popular history and social studies teacher at Interlake from the late 60's through the mid 70's. He once even played the lead in the IHS stage production of "The Man of La Mancha." Sadly, he died towards the end on April 12, 1976 in a car crash on the Olympic Penninsula. A drunk driver pulled out in front of him on highway 101, two miles west of Port Angeles, and Dick's car crashed into him.

Dick Warner's death was one of those things that affected many of the students who were at Interlake at the time, as you can see from the comments below. A page was dedicated to him at the back of the 1976 yearbook, which you can also find below.
