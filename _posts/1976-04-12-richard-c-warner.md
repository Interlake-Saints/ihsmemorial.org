Dick Warner was a popular history and social studies teacher at Interlake from the late 60s through the mid 70s. He even acted in IHS school plays on occasion, including memorable turns in "Fiddler on the Roof" and "The Man of La Mancha."

Sadly, he died on April 12, 1976 in a car crash on the Olympic Penninsula. A drunk driver pulled out in front of him on highway 101, two miles west of Port Angeles, and Dick's car crashed into him. 

Dick Warner's death was one of those things that affected many of the students who were at Interlake at the time, as you can see from the comments below. A page was dedicated to him at the back of the 1976 yearbook, which you can also find below in the comments.
