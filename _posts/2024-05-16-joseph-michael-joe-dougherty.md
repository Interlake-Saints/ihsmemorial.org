After graduating from Interlake, Joe joined the Navy. He was a custom millworker for most of his life, and was known for being able to build just about ANYTHING. He just had a knack for it. He was also more recently known for driving a taxi in Butte, Montana. Joe always had something funny or quirky to say about most things. His sense of humor will be greatly missed.

Joe enjoyed doing anything outdoors. He was a master fisherman, and he passed that knowledge on to his family. He also enjoyed hunting, camping, and going on drives. He loved exploring any back roads in his beautiful state of Montana. And boy did he put in some miles! Joe enjoyed spending time with his “kids” and being Gramps, but there was nothing he loved more than spending time with his two girls, Layla and Aaliyah. And also his number one girl, his cat Pepper.

Sadly, Joe passed away in Butte on Wednesday, September 27, 2023, with his family by his side, after fighting a long battle with his health. He was 65 years old.

His passing left anyone who knew him with a heavy heart. You will be severely missed, Papa Bear.
