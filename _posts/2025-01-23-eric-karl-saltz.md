Eric (who went by "Rick" in high school) was born in Tacoma in 1952, to Geraldine and Warren Saltz. He grew up in Longview (WA) and West Salem (OR) before his family eventually settled in Bellevue in the mid 60s, where he attended Highland Middle School and then the brand-new Interlake High School. He graduated from Interlake in the class of 1970.

After Interlake, he attended the University of Washington, where he graduated with a degree in biochemistry. He followed that up by obtaining his medical degree from UW in 1978. He then spent the rest of his life as a doctor.

Eric eventually settled in Lake Tahoe, and he obtained a Nevada medical license. And it is there where he met his wife Tida, a future dentist. The couple eventually married, and moved down to Henderson, Nevada, where Tida opened a dental practice, and Eric practiced emergency medicine in the greater Las Vegas area. The couple remained in Nevada for the rest of their lives. They eventually had two children as well, Sterling and Linnea.

Sadly, after a lifetime of treating patients, Doctor Eric Saltz passed away of heart failure, at his home in Las Vegas, on October 7, 2024. He was just eight days short of his 72nd birthday.
