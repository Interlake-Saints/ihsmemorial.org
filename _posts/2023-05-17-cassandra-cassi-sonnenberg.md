Cassi, who was also known as Cassi Carter, loved her years of work with the King County Sheriffs Department as a fingerprint technician. She also enjoyed cooking, following the Seattle Seahawks and Washington State Cougars, and most of all, spending time with her family and friends. She was loving, caring, selfless, family-oriented, and most of all, just a beautiful happy go lucky person. She was loved by all, and will forever be missed. 

Cassi is survived by her life partner, Gary Carter, her siblings Venus and Larry, and her children Amber, Sharon, and Devon. She is also survived by two grandchildren and an aunt and uncle, Gail and Mike.

Cassi passed away peacefully in Pennsylvania on Sunday, March 5th, 2023. She was 52 years old.
