On November 12, 1982, Alice was found in her car in Bellingham at 2:00 in the morning. She was slumped over her steering wheel and the car's headlights were still on. Efforts were made to revive her, but with no success. No cause of death was publicly announced, but foul play was not suspected. Alice was a 23 year old student at Western Washington University at the time.
