Jenny had Down Syndrome, autism, and other special needs. She was quite the character and with doting mother Sabina always by her side, the pair were well known on Mercer Island. She was a regular at the Highland Community Center in Bellevue, and also volunteered at the Issaquah Food Bank.

The last five years of her life, Jenny felt a sense of independence, moving out of her parents’ house and living in “Mountain House,” her group home in Issaquah. She developed close bonds with her caregivers and co-residents. They remember her as being one tough cookie, and a practical joker with a sweet side.

Jenny passed away suddenly and peacefully on April 17, 2021. She was 40 years old.
