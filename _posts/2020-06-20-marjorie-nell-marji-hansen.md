Marji Hansen was a teacher in the Bellevue School District (with stops at Tyee, Interlake, and Sammamish) for forty years, where she taught over 5,000 students shorthand, computers, keyboarding, and business skills. In her spare time, she enjoyed attending Mariners games, especially spring training in Peoria, AZ as a season ticket holder with prime seats behind home plate. She was also a staunch Seahawks fan. One of her proudest personal achievements was winning runner-up in the Ms. Springfield, MO pageant prior to starting college.

A caregiver and entertainer at heart, Marge (or "Marji" as many would call her) obtained various nicknames over the years, from "Nurse Marge" to "Nutty Nell." She was the person you wanted to care for you when you were sick, and make you laugh when you were down. She had a wicked, crazy sense of humor and always enjoyed brightening someone's day with a thoughtful note, a small gift, or a simple invitation to spend time talking together. She was a beautiful, caring human being inside and out with a heart of gold, a farmer's work ethic, a sharp-as-a-tack teacher's brain and wit, and an unbreakable fighting spirit, having survived cancer not once, but twice. She will be missed by many and forever in our hearts.

Marji Hansen departed this world on June 20, 2020, at her home in Litchfield Park, AZ. She was 82 years old.
