Wes completed 9th grade at Highland Junior High in 1971, along with the rest of his friends, but he was diagnosed with cancer in the August before he would have started high school at Interlake. He dropped out of school to begin cancer treatment, and it's unclear if he ever actually attended Interlake or not. But the class of '74 adopted him as one of their own, and they have always considered him part of their graduating class.

Sadly, Wes passed away of cancer on April 23, 1972, in the middle of what would have been his sophomore year at Interlake. He was only fifteen years old.

The Bellevue American ran a front page article about Wes the day after he died. He is buried in Sunset Hills Memorial Park in Bellevue.
