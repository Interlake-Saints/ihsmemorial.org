Kimberly, aka Kimberly Ann Gray of Greenville, South Carolina, was a first class wife, a world class mother, a friend in a class by herself, and in every way a lady of class. She was self-employed, and was an award-winning interior and restaurant designer. Her works included Street of Dreams winning designs in both Seattle and Greenville.

Sadly, Kimberly passed away on February 28, 2014. She was 55 years old.
