Jim, who broke the all time Kingco football rushing record his senior year at Interlake, was on a six-month Naval deployment to Spain and the Portuguese Azore Islands when he died in a plane crash on December 11, 1977. His crew's four-engine turboprop plane was on a routine submarine surveillance mission when it crashed on the smallest of the Spanish Canary Islands, Hierro, off the coast of North Africa.
