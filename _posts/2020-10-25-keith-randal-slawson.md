Keith graduated from the University of Washington in 1987 with a BA in graphic design, and he later worked at several Seattle advertising agencies and design firms. His favorite job title was Transmogrifier — defined as “one who transforms in a surprising or magical manner.” This title certainly described what he loved to do, both professionally and personally.

Keith played his first Dungeons and Dragons game in 1978, and he was hooked for the rest of his life. He loved how the game evolved to become more diverse and inclusive, which matched his passion for social justice. He loved playing characters who challenged preconceived notions, and he enjoyed researching deep background stories. He also loved creating and recreating new rules structures (to the admiration and sometimes frustration of his players at times!). If Keith were a D&D character, he would most certainly be a Paladin: putting honor and ethics above all else.

On October 25, 2020, Keith Slawson wrote the final chapter of his story. He was 56 years old. Though he dealt with cancer for the past six years, he viewed it as just a footnote in his much bigger life story. And he will always be remembered for his signature of two differently-colored shoes: Converse Chuck Taylor All-Stars- one red and one blue.
