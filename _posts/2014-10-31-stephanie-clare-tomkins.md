Stephanie, aka Stephanie Clare Hailey, was undergoing an emergency procedure on October 31, 2014, to remove an obstruction in her stomach when she suffered cardiac arrest. She was 44 years old. Remembered as a bright, cheerful, attractive and lively young girl, she was loved by her family both in the USA and England and will always be in their hearts.
