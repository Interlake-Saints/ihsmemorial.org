Karen, aka Karen Ann Brown, graduated from Interlake in 1970, and continued her education at Western Washington University, where she received her B.A. in Elementary Education. She then taught first grade, kindergarten, and (mainly) pre-kindergarten for the next thirty-four years, mostly in Wenatchee at St. Paul's Lutheran School.

Sadly, Karen passed away on June 20, 2011. She was 58 years old.

Unfortunately, Karen is not the only member of her family on this page. Her younger sister, [Sheila Marie Hawkins](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1972/sheila-marie-hawkins/), passed away in 2021.
