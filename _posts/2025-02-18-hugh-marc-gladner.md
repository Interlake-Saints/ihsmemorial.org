It is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Hugh Gladner, our beloved father, husband, coach, friend, and our favorite BBQ master. Hugh passed away on January 18th, 2025, after a courageous battle with cancer. 

Hugh was raised in Bellevue, and graduated from Interlake in 1984. He then went on to the University of Oregon, where he graduated in 1989. And although he had a long career in sales and management, what he was mostly known for in his lifetime was being a coach and a mentor to the children of Bellevue.

Hugh was a leader and role model on the Eastside for nearly three decades. In particular, his contributions to the Bellevue football program were invaluable, as he touched the lives of many young people along the way. Hugh even ran for the Bellevue School Board in 2017, in an effort to help clean up the schools. His love for his community was immense and, because of this, so many people in Bellevue over the years either knew him, were friends with him, had a BBQ cooked by him, or were coached by him.

Hugh was diagnosed with stage four ocular melanoma in January of 2024, and he and his family moved to Arizona to begin specialized treatments. And although he fought his cancer for more than a year, he passed away on January 18, 2025. And with it, the world lost a remarkable teacher, coach, mentor, and counselor.

You fought the fight, now rest in peace. We will all miss you Coach Hugh.
