Jeanine graduated from Interlake with honors, and went on to attend the University of Washington. She began a career in optometry in her mid 20s, but a brain tumor derailed her life and her plans. She fought through the adversity, however, and although she struggled, she learned how to walk and talk again, albeit in her own style.

Jeanine loved people. She really had the gift of gab. She could always capture an audience, whether you were willing or not. She also enjoyed board games, music, dancing, and fashion. She loved her family and was always consistent and punctual in sending birthday cards. She had an unconditional love for kitties and babies. There are many stories of the times she would rescue and adopt a motherless fur baby. She also enjoyed speaking fluent Spanish. She loved the fact she could master the language even after the tumor took other essentials away from her. 

Jeanine went to be with her Lord and Savior Jesus Christ on August 5, 2022, at her home in Federal Way. She died of natural causes. She was 55 years old.
