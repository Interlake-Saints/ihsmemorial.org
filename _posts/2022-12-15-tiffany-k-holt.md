After Interlake, Tiffany married fellow '86 grad [Christopher Akridge](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1986/christopher-lee-akridge/), and they eventually had two children together, Payton and Wyatt. Tiffany then spent the next eighteen years of her life as a flight attendant for Delta Airlines, based out of Salt Lake City. She always loved to travel, so being a flight attendant was a perfect fit for her.

Tiffany got divorced in 2006, and retired from her job, and she eventually wound up back in Seattle. And in 2017, her health and mobility started to steadily decline. Doctors didn't know what was happening at first, but after several years of struggling to find a diagnosis, she was eventually ruled in mid-2021 to have ALS. She battled ALS for several months, before eventually passing away on the morning of August 24, 2021.

Tiffany was a wonderful and beloved mother to her two sons, and she meant the world to them. They are going to miss her.
