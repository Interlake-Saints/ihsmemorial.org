Tiffany, aka Tiffany K. Akridge, married fellow ‘86 grad[Christoper Akridge](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1986/christopher-lee-akridge/) after graduating from Interlake, and they eventually had two children together. Tiffany then spent the next eighteen years of her life as a flight attendant for Delta Airlines, based out of Salt Lake City. She always loved to travel, so being a flight attendant was a perfect fit for her.

Tiffany got divorced in 2006, and she retired from her job, and she eventually wound up back in Seattle. And in 2017, her health and mobility started to decline. Doctors didn’t know what was happening at first, but after several years of struggling to find an answer, she was eventually diagnosed in mid-2021 with ALS. She battled ALS for several months, before passing away on the morning of August 24, 2021.

Tiffany was a wonderful and beloved mother to her two sons, Payton and Wyatt, and she meant the world to them. She is going to be missed.
