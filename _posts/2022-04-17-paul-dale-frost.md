Paul served in the United States Navy as a submariner from 1971 until 1992, where he achieved the rank of Senior Chief Machinist Mate. After serving his country, he worked as a purchasing agent for the Illiana Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Danville, Illinois. He enjoyed playing the bass guitar, listening to music, woodworking, and watching a variety of movies in his free time. He loved a good puzzle and a great salmon steak. He was also an avid sports fan and was a longtime supporter of the Seattle Seahawks and Seattle Mariners. But his very favorite pastime was simply playing cribbage with his family. He loved his family deeply, and his family loved him deeply in return.

Sadly, Paul passed away on April 6, 2022, due to complications from ALS. He passed away at his home in St. Joseph, IL, with his family by his side. He was 69 years old. 

His loss will leave an irreplaceable hole.
