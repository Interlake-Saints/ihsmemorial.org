Daniel was murdered by an acquaintance on July 7, 2021. He was shot in the chest in the parking lot of Factoria movie theater, and was pronounced dead later at Seattle's Harborview Hospital.

Daniel was a junior at Interlake, and he was known as a respectful, kind, funny, humble and hard-working young man, who was excited about his future because he had just purchased his first car. He was only 17 years old.
