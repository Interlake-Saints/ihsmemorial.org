Wayne was a sailor and a Navy veteran who loved his cats, loved building things, and loved racing cars. He was the well-known owner and operator of Red Band Racing 22, which was a NASCAR team dedicated to helping disabled veterans. His was a kind giant of a man with a big heart who was a hard worker, was stronger than an ox, but was also funny and crass. His friends say they will miss his larger than life stature, his sense of humor, and his love for all things cats. One of his dreams was to open a cat rescue center at some point in the future.

Wayne was battling cancer when he passed away, but it wasn't the cancer that killed him. On March 6, 2021, he was working under a car hauler he was rebuilding when it accidentally shifted and fell on him, and he died instantly. Many of the tributes to him online stated that he would have preferred to go that way, as opposed to the cancer taking him. Because at least this way he went out building something, which was something he loved.

Wayne didn't want to be buried. Because of his Naval background he specifically wanted his ashes spread out to sea, from the USS Nimitz. So his friends contacted the Navy, and got the legal permission, and they made sure that happened. It was a fitting tribute to a man who was always so proud of his service, exploits, shenanigans, and the life-long friends that he made in the Navy.

Wayne was 61 years old when he died.
