Mark Pasion lived his life truly unapologetically. He found joy and passion in spending time with family, golfing, cooking, fishing, shooting, cars, motorcycles, home projects, and making people happy. He worked for years in the glass industry, with his most recent job being a project manager at All New Glass.

Anyone that knew Mark would say he was a happy-go-lucky, bright, beautiful soul that always put others before himself, and wanted the best for everyone. His constant smile and laughter could light up anyoneâ€™s day. He was a true believer in fellowship, and always grateful and appreciative of all the blessings in his life. We love and miss you Mark, and may your spirit rest peacefully and become one with God.

Mark passed away on September 22, 2021. He was 59 years old.
