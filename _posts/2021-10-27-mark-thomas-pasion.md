Mark Thomas Pasion, 59, of Kent, Washington, passed away on 22 September 2021.

Working years in the Glass industry, Mark would come to success as a Project Manager for a notable glass company known as All New Glass. He had been with the company for over 10 years and truly enjoyed and appreciated all of the people he had the opportunity to work along with. 

Living his life truly unapologetically, Mark found joy and passion in spending time with family, golfing, cooking, fishing, shooting, cars, motorcycles, home projects and making people happy. 

Mark met the love of his life, Stella Marie Avila, in 1984 at the bar Jungle Jim’s in Bellevue, Washington. After 4 years of romance, they married on March 19th, 1988 in Redmond, Washington. Together they raised two children: Joe and Mitchell. For the foreseeable future, they would move to Kent, Washington to spend the rest of their lives. 

Anyone that knew Mark could easily say he was a happy-go-lucky, bright, beautiful soul that always put others before himself and wanted the best for everyone. His undenying smile and laughter could light up anyone’s day in which he found much happiness. Mark was a true believer in fellowship and always grateful and appreciative of all the blessings in his life. To no surprise, he was a true blessing to all of us as well. We love and miss you Mark, and may your spirit rest peacefully and become one with God.
