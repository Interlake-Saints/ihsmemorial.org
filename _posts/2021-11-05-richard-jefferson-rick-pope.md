Richard "Rick" J. Pope, 64, passed away suddenly on May 9, 2021, on his way to Ninilchik, Alaska, to go fishing with friends.

Rick was born in Fairbanks, the territory of Alaska, to Richard "Dick" Pope and Lois Myers. Dick Pope established P,R & S Inc. and Alaska Tank Fabricators in Anchorage, and Lois owned the Persian Room in Fairbanks until the flood in '67. Rick was raised in Fairbanks, Anchorage and Bellevue, Wash. A fine athlete, he held high jump records and loved playing basketball and football. Rick was highly intelligent, could play any musical instrument and was a math and science quiz. After graduating from Interlake High School he was offered scholarships to multiple colleges, including medical school in the Midwest. He opted for the "school of life" as he called it, moved back to Alaska to work construction for his dad and became a premier welder.

Ricky was a 40-year member of the Boilermakers Union Local 502 and his work throughout Alaska, the Lower 48, Guam and beyond is legendary. He made his home in Wasilla, Alaska, raising an amazing herd of dogs and cats; his pet cemetery is a shrine to the animals he adored. He was an avid reader, loved challenging his brain with crosswords and taking care of everyone that needed help. Rick loved to fish and found solace on the river bank of the Clearwater or a boat on the inlet.

Surviving is his sister, Patty Brandt and her husband Dave; brother, Steve Pope and wife Barbara; nephew, Justin Brandt, wife Kirsten; and cousins, Trish Tyler and Crystal Meade. Scattered loving relatives far and wide mourn his loss. Rick's huge heart touched so many as evidenced by his long list of great friends. Roll on Ricky, your heart was too big for this world.
