Rick was raised in Fairbanks and Anchorage as well as Bellevue, and he lived in Alaska for most of his life. A fine athlete, he held high jump records in high school, and he also loved playing basketball and football. Rick was highly intelligent. He could play any musical instrument and he was also a math and science whiz. After graduating from Interlake, he was offered scholarships to multiple colleges, including medical school in the Midwest. He opted instead for the "school of life", as he called it, and moved back to Alaska to work construction for his dad, and became a premier welder.

Ricky was a forty-year member of the Boilermakers Union Local 502, and his work throughout Alaska, the Lower 48, Guam, and beyond is legendary. He made his home in Wasilla, Alaska, raising an amazing herd of dogs and cats; his pet cemetery is a shrine to the animals he adored over the years. He was an avid reader, loved challenging his brain with crosswords, and taking care of everyone that needed help. Rick loved to fish and found solace on the riverbank of the Clearwater or a boat on the inlet. His huge heart touched so many, as evidenced by his long list of great friends.

Sadly, Rick passed away on May 9, 2021, while he was driving to Ninilchik, Alaska, to go fishing with friends. He had a sudden medical event while driving, which caused his car to crash into a tree. He was 64 years old.

Roll on Ricky, your heart was too big for this world.
