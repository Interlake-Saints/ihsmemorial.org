Bill was well known as a musician in his lifetime, from his first garage band "Arsenal", to the recording studio he later ran with his sons. He was also known as a great friend, a super funny guy, and a person who was very positive and kind. He was always making people smile and laugh, and he was one of a kind. Sadly, he died unexpectedly on August 16, 2014.

Bill left behind a wife of twenty-seven years, Pam, and two sons who he loved with all of his heart. He was 51 years old.
