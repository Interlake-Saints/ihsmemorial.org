Bob served as principal at St. Alphonsus in Ballard, and was later the long time principal at St. Bernadette in Burien, where he remained until he retired in 2013. He was well loved by the many teachers, parents, and students whose lives he touched at those institutions. He died unexpectedly in Seattle on May 19, 2015 at the age of 63.
