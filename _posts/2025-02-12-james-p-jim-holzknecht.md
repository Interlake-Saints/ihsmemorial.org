After graduating from Interlake in 1981, Jim went on to play football for the University of Washington. He then went on to wear many hats over the next forty years (even living in Russia at one point), in a life that touched many, and made a tremendous impact upon the world.

Jim eventually became a best-selling author, an award-winning producer, a passionate yoga teacher, and an inspiration to all who were lucky enough to cross his path. He was known around the world for the empowering and inspiring content he created. From the numerous books that he wrote, to his podcast "Play by Play on Life", to the feature film he co-produced, "Beyond Belief." He also wrote, produced, and directed several educational documentary films. He dedicated his life to empowering others to lead a life that they loved. He particularly empowered people in his final role, as a popular yoga teacher in Texas.

Jim was diagnosed with cancer later in life, but this did not stop his zest for living. In response to his diagnosis, he created the non-profit groups [Jumping Jim](https://www.jumpingjim.com/) and Cicada Rising, which both aimed to support others diagnosed with cancer, and their families. Right up until the end, Jim battled cancer with a positive attitude, and a contagious zeal for life. He was known for always being positive, and always having a big smile on his face. He will be deeply missed by many.

Sadly, Jim lost his battle with cancer on January 11, 2025. He was 61 years old.

Unfortunately, Jim is not the only member of his family on this page. His older sister, [Susan Holzknecht](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1970/susan-marie-holzknecht/), passed away in March of 2006.
