Karen, aka Karen Lee Wolfe Boggs, was warm, funny and forthright; she was known for her long, infectious laugh and gritty comments, an earth mother with an irreverent edge.

At her country home she presided over a menagerie of well-bred Jack Russell terriers and assorted barnyard critters. She always found time, space, and energy for others, whether human or animal. While under her care, such beings got the full benefit of her knowledgeable nursing and tough love, plus the full dose of Wolfe family wit. Especially needy or mistreated animals filled her life.

Sadly, Karen died at her home in Snohomish on Jan. 19, 2002. She was 49 years old.
