Richard Gene Howe was born June 4th, 1958, in Huntsville, Alabama to Carol Jean Turner and later adopted by Robert Gene Howe. He graduated from Interlake High School in Bellevue, Washington in 1977 and studied Broadcast Journalism at the Columbia School of Broadcasting. He was married to Nancy Moore, formerly McClellan, of Murray, Utah for 25 years and together they raised four amazing children. Later in life he found his true love and was married to Jill Howe on November 5th, 2016 and they spent an amazing year together in honeymoon bliss.

Rick was an avid fly fisherman, golfer and sports fan. In his earlier years he enjoyed participating in Boy Scouts and volunteered as a referee for the Latter-Day Saints youth sports leagues. He loved spending time with his family, especially his wife, children, and his grandson. He had such a giving heart; he enjoyed spending Christmas Eveâ€™s playing Santa and delivering presents for sick and disadvantaged youth. He was truly an amazing man, and words could never describe the loss that is felt.

Sadly, Rick passed away less than a year after his second marriage, on October 13, 2017. He was 59 years old.
