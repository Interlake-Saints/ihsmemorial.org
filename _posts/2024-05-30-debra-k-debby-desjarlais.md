Debby was an air traffic controller and author, who was better known under her pen name "Delia Colvin." As Delia Colvin, she was an award-winning novelist, with over 150,000 books in print worldwide. She was also a paid screenwriter. At the time of her death, she was in talks for her very first movie.

Debby was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2019. And she fought her disease valiantly all the way to the end. She even insisted on having a beach bonfire with family and friends right at the end, where she danced and sang in her wheelchair. She was then carried back to her home by the fire department, where she left this life peacefully. 

Debby, aka Delia, passed away in Corona, California on May 17, 2022. She leaves behind her daughter, Jennifer Youngs, and two granddaughters. She also leaves behind, of course, a dedicated fanbase of author Delia Colvin.
