Nina (aka Nina Rae Wesson) passed away on Tuesday, May 2, 2006, after a severe strep infection. She was 35 years old.

In Nina's honor, [a plaque](https://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMCBW3_Nina_Rae_Wesson_Santa_Clara_CA) in Santa Clara, California's Everett Alvarez Jr. Park was dedicated on a bench with her name on it. [A children's community center](https://childreninternational.blogspot.com/2007_08_01_archive.html) in Guadalajara, Mexico was also named in her honor.

And here is [a 2006 blog entry](https://trinket-t.blogspot.com/2006/09/how-nina-wesson-died.html) written by her friend, about how Nina died.
