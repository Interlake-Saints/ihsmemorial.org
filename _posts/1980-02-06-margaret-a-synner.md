Peggy had just rented a house in Bellevue when it caught fire the last day of January, 1980. She was taken to Harborview Medical Center where she died of her injuries a week later, on February 6, 1980. She was only 19 years old.

Sadly, Peggy's brother, [Michael](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1981/michael-r-synner/), is also listed on the IHS Memorial Wall. His entry is under the Class of 1981.
