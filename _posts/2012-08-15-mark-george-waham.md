Mark had many health problems throughout his life. He was born with hearing loss, and then became a diabetic at the age of 19. He then developed kidney disease and had to start dialysis when he went into renal failure in 2008. He also had heart disease, which culminated in a major heart attack in 2010 that led to a triple bypass. Mark survived many things over the years, but he eventually passed away on August 15, 2012, while surrounded by loved ones.
