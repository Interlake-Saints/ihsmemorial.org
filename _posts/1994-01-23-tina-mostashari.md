Tina was a young mother who was out at night with her friends for the first time since her daughter was born. Crammed into their car- two in the front, three in the back- the five young women were driving on Rainier Avenue South a little after 1 A.M. on January 23, 1994, when a single bullet came crashing through the rear window. It hit Tina in the back of the head, killing her. She had just turned 21 years old.

The women did not know who shot them, and none of them had any gang affiliations, so the crime was officially determined to be a random shooting. 

Being a mother was the joy and focus of her life, her brother later said in an interview. "She loved living for the moment. She was a leader. Supportive towards all her friends, the one they turned to. And she was always there for them. She was the only daughter in the family, and our family is devastated."

No one was ever arrested for the crime. Tina's murder remains unsolved to this day.

Sadly, Tina is not the only member of her family on this page. Her older brother, [Ali](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1981/amir-ali-ali-mostashari/), passed away in 2025.
