Keith was a star soccer player at Interlake, and later became a well known lighting director and designer in the Rock 'n Roll world. He lit up the likes of Neil Young, Jack Johnson, Ben Harper, John Mellencamp, The Cowboys, Pearl Jam, Lyle Lovett and most recently guitarist Gary Clark Jr., to name a few. He traveled the world many times over and befriended every artist he designed and directed for. Sadly, Keith passed away on July 30, 2017, after a courageous 14-month battle with pancreatic cancer.
