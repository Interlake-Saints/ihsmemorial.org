Carol, aka Carol Bliss Pieratt, died of a stroke on June 13, 2021. She was 58 years old.

Sadly, Carol isn't the only member of her family on the IHS Memorial Wall. Her older brother [Kevin](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1974/kevin-malcolm-bliss/), and her sisters [Linda](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1979/linda-renee-bliss/) and [Mary](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1982/mary-bliss/) also have entries on the page. All four were born with the same rare genetic condition, and they all died young.
