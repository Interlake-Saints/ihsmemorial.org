Reverend Eric Paul Stratmeyer was a soldier of grace, an interpreter of the Holy word, and a man of many intellectual interests. He lived a life in the light of God, always ready to be with his Father. Eric believed in the power of God's love and forgiveness. He is home with the lord now. May the lord bless him and keep him.

It is with heavy hearts that Kathie, Will and Sam must share that Eric passed away suddenly last Friday, 2-18-22.  He died at home from natural causes. He suffered from poor heart health and  "his heart gave out". 
There will be a memorial service with details to follow.  We take comfort in knowing that he is finally at the wedding supper of the lamb...where he always longed to be.
