Reverend Eric Paul Stratmeyer was a soldier of grace, an interpreter of the Holy Word, and a man of many intellectual interests. He lived a life in the light of God, always ready to be with his Father. 

Eric began his career at Boeing, before leaving in 1994 to study theology and preaching at Fuller Seminary. After obtaining his Masters of Divinity, he then became a youth, associate, and senior pastor at various churches across Washington, California, Illinois, and Minnesota. At the time of his death, he was the executive director at Romans8.org, a non-profit organization that seeks to educate people about basic theology.

Sadly, Eric suffered from poor heart health in his later years, and in the words of his family, "his heart gave out" on Friday, February 18, 2022. He died at home of natural causes. But his family takes comfort in knowing that he is finally at the wedding supper of the lamb... where he always longed to be.
