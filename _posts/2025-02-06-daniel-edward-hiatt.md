After his graduation in 1980, Dan worked at a construction company in Bellevue. He was also a self-taught mechanic. But his life changed significantly in his mid-twenties, when he was involved in an ATV accident. He broke his neck in the accident, and he became a paraplegic.

Even though Dan was confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life, that did not stop him. He became a mechanic using the skills he had taught himself while younger, and for the rest of his life he was mainly known for his love of cars. Cars, and of course his long-time wife Patty, who he loved very much.

Dan and Patty had a shared love for classic cars, and over time they amassed an amazing collection together. The highlight of Dan's collection was a restored 1968 Dodge Charger, which he bought back in high school, and later restored to its old former glory. A photo of the car can be found below, in the comments. Dan even had hand controls installed in the Charger so he could drive it around. He was a wonderful inspiration to everyone who knew him, and he amassed many close friends along the way. His friends always knew him for his big personality and his great attitude.

Sadly, Dan passed away on September 26, 2024, from complications of cancer. He was 63 years old.
