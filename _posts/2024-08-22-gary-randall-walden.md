Gary started working for his family's trucking company soon after high school, and he worked there for most of his life. With a brief break in the middle driving a semi for his friends' band, Rail. He married the love of his life, Susan, in 1989, and they were together for thirty-three years.

Gary was a great friend, a great husband, a great father, a great coworker, and a brother to all. He enjoyed vacationing in the Canadian Rockies, going to rock festivals, and deer hunting. And most importantly, according to his friends, there may not have been a more honest, caring, straight-shooting soul in the world than Gary Walden's.

Sadly, Gary died of pancreatic cancer on December 3, 2022. He was 67 years old.
