As a toddler, David lost his mother to cancer - he never knew his birth mother. He was raised by U.S. Air Force Captain Eula Nell Chesterman, a loving stepmother who stepped into his life after meeting and marrying his father, U.S. Air Force Colonel Charles Chesterman. He graduated from Interlake in 1978.

For decades, David worked during the daytime as a self-employed carpenter, building many home improvement projects, including decks and interiors. But after his day job ended, he went to the job he was REALLY known for. For more than forty years, he was a well known drummer in the Northwest rock scene.

Over the last forty-five years, David's recording credits are too numerous to mention - but undoubtedly, the most recognizable act he has worked with is Rail. As a professional drummer since the early 80s, Dave's first band was Soldier. He also played with Who Found Who, Daddy Long Legs, No Mas, Jackie Rome, DeDDBolt, The Shortcuts, The Susie Garcia Orchestra, Mimeograf, Rival of Kings, Fusion Eyes, and Trike, among others. Dave's credits on Rail's "Big World" album include the opening track, Call My Name, Need Your Lovin' (Track 2), and Don't Run Away (Track 7).

Unfortunately, after forty-plus years in the Seattle rock scene, Dave died of cancer of December 29, 2024. 

At the time of his death, Dave mentioned that he was grateful for his many blessings - including a son that loves him, a beautiful granddaughter, many lifelong friends, and relationships with many magnificent musicians. In essence, his life involved decades of building friendships, a family, rhythms and carpentry projects.
