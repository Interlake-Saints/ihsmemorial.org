Jean, aka D. Jean Harrick, grew up in Bellevue, and it was at Interlake where she developed her love of horticulture. After graduation, she eventually established a commercial interior plant business called "Ms. Jean's Greens", which she ran by herself for decades, all the way up to her retirement. Outside of her love of plants, Jean was a passionate ski instructor at Bellevue Ski School and Husky Winter Sports, and also an avid golfer.

Sadly, Jean passed away peacefully on September 22, 2023, after an eighteen-year fight with multiple sclerosis. She was 67 years old. She is survived by her loving husband of forty-two years, John.
