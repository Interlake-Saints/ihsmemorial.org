Briton, aka Briton Elizabeth Rivers-Rulman, worked as a senior claims adjuster for St. Paul/Traveler’s Insurance after graduating from Interlake. She held this job up until her retirement in 1996. After retirement, Briton spent considerable time in service of others. Her volunteer endeavors included classroom assistance at St. Mark Catholic School in Shoreline, Eucharistic Ministry for homebound members of St. Elizabeth Seton Catholic Church in Carmel, Indiana, and early childhood development/reading assistance at St. Mary’s Early Childhood Center in Indianapolis. In addition to these volunteer positions, Briton also served as club secretary for the Rotary Club of Northeast Indianapolis.

Briton’s personal interests included music, reading, sports, fitness, the outdoors, and every one of her many pets. Aside from the perpetual suffering that is the life of every Seattle Mariners fan, she was also an ever-present and avid supporter of her children’s athletic pursuits. As her children grew older, she became a full-time chauffeur, often ferrying them to baseball tournaments and camps all around the United States. Her enthusiasm and support for her children’s interests were unparalleled; her personal interests always paled in comparison to the devotion she showed as a mother.

In her final years, she was able to realize her lifelong dream of living on the water, and she enjoyed this life to the fullest possible extent. With her husband, Bruce, she spent many hours walking, relaxing, and enjoying beautiful sunsets on the beach at her Lake Michigan cottage.

Throughout her life, Briton’s infectious smile, sense of humor, and graciousness had a defined effect on all who came to know her. She was deeply loved by all of her family and friends, and she will be dearly missed. 

Briton passed away on Saturday, September 3, 2022. She was 66 years old.
