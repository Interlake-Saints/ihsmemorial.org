Nell, aka Nell Ann Shelton, married her Jr. High School sweetheart, Don Shelton, in 1972, and they stayed together and raised a family for more than forty-five years. She also worked in accounting for 45 years before retiring in May of 2017. Sadly, Nell went to be with Jesus on Tuesday, March 24, 2000, after a valiant eight-month fight with cancer. She was 68 years old.
