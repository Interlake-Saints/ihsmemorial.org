Cherrye was the wife of former IHS Football coach Brian Mitchell, and she was also the IHS cheer advisor. She worked diligently to direct kids into activities and athletics to keep them off the streets and out of trouble. Cherrye dreamed of starting a community home for misdirected teenagers. She envisioned a safe place where young adults could live and bring focus back to their lives, but sadly, her dreams never materialized. She died of breast cancer on April 1, 1997. She was only 38 years old.

In Cherrye's honor, a $1,000 scholarship is now given away each year to one outstanding IHS scholar-athlete.
