David Bruce Kirbyson (known to everyone as Bruce) was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and he later lived in Calgary, Burnaby (BC), and then Bellevue. His nickname as a child was “Boo Boo”, and he had a busy life with his three brothers and two sisters. He always was a character, with a voice and a laugh that when you heard it, you always knew he was nearby. He also had a smile that, according to his friends, would always get him out of so much trouble. From a young age, he had a passion for cars, and this continued for all of his life.

Bruce did not graduate from Interlake, but he attended it for his sophomore year and possibly part of his junior year. 

Bruce married his wife Colleen in 1984, and he worked as an appliance repair man. But then, thanks to his dad, he opened and ran Associated Ceiling Cleaners. He worked hard to get this company up and running, and he made many business client friends along the way.

Whether it be at the hockey rink, soccer field, or any other interest they might have, Bruce was very involved with his boys. He loved to camp, fish, boat, and snowmobile, and his boys benefited from all of it. He loved to travel with Colleen and did many trips with her and the boys; they even bought a place in Phoenix, Arizona in 2008 where they vacationed every year and attended Nascar car racing, one of his passions and favourite things to do.

Bruce eventually retired, and he and his family settled in Peachland, BC. He could not have been happier, living across from a lake full of fish. And a community that had everything he wanted. He touched so many lives in this small community because he was always willing to help anyone, and if he could find someone to talk fishing with, have a beer with, or watch the NFL with, he was happy. He was a simple man who loved classic cars, classic rock, and comfort food. He didn’t like technology.

Bruce, you were taken from us far too fast and far too young. Our loss is heaven’s gain, and we hope that you and Key are fishing in God’s lake and are waiting to catch the big one. Missed forever, forgotten never.

Bruce Kirbyson passed away peacefully surrounded by family on January 15, 2023. He was 62 years old.
