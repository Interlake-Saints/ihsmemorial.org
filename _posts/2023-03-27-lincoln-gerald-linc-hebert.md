Lincoln Gerald Hebert (Linc) passed away on March 12, 2023. He was 58 years old.

He was born on June 2, 1964, in Spearfish, South Dakota to Margaret and Gerald Hebert. He moved to the state of Washington in 1973 with his parents and sisters at the age of 9, and graduated from Interlake in 1982.

Linc loved watching Seattle sports, and was an avid Seahawks fan. From a young age, he was also obsessed with airplanes.  He had just started a job at Boeing, where he was working on building planes, and was so excited about the opportunity.

Linc did not have children of his own but had many fur babies throughout his life.  His kitties were like family to him. He is survived by his parents, Margaret and Gerald, his sisters Cherise and Jennie, and his niece and nephew, Izzy and Braden.
