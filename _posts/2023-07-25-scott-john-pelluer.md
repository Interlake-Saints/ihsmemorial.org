Born in Yakima, Scott Pelluer was the oldest of three boys. He was a star football player at Interlake until his graduation in 1977, and he then became a four-year starter at outside linebacker for Washington State. In 1977 he was the first freshman to start a game for the Cougars, and for the rest of his career he was a key figure on the WSU defense. He was drafted in the fourth round of the 1981 NFL draft, and he went on to play five seasons (1981-1986) as a popular player for the New Orleans Saints.

"Scott was one of those guys you never had to look over your shoulder on from a special teams standpoint," said former Saint Rich Mauti, who was a teammate of Pelluer for three seasons. "He was one of those guys you knew he was always going to be there. His personality was such that you would look at him and talk to him and would think he can't be a football player, because he's too nice and he doesn't have a mean bone in his body. But he was able to turn it on when he got on the field. He was a special teammate."

During his time in New Orleans, Pelluer was also very active in the local community, as he was a 1984 Saints/Miller Lite Man of the Year candidate after he initiated the "Winning Touch Football Camp" to raise fund for Louisiana Special Olympics. He later served on the board of directors of the Ronald McDonald House.

"We are and were blessed to be able to do what we did and get paid for it, and many of us feel it's an obligation to give back," said Mauti. "I remember when Scott was involved in the Special Olympics. He was one of those guys who always cared about people. That's a personality trait, that wasn't only in the locker room with Scott. He got involved. He not only had a passion for football but had a lifetime passion to help people."

After his playing days were over, Scott coached football for two decades at various college programs, including spending time on both sides of the Washington State Apple Cup rivalry. He also served as an analyst for WSU radio broadcasts, working alongside legendary play-by-play broadcaster Bob Robertson. Overall, the Pelluer family has one of the deepest football bloodlines in the state, with four generations of Pelluers starring at WSU.

“He absolutely loved Washington State,” said Scott's brother, Steve. “I don’t think he could’ve had a better college experience.”

Sadly, Scott suffered a heart attack in June of 2023, and he was placed into a medically induced coma. He died several days later, in Seattle, on June 26, 2023. He was 64 years old.
