Travis was many things to many, many people; a son, a brother, a friend, a love of one's life, a co-worker, a gentle 6'8" giant, a source of constant comedy relief, a world traveler, an intellectual, a foodie, a geek, someone who gave the absolute best hugs, and on and on. His heart gave out unexpectedly in Cambodia on June 18, 2012 while doing one of the things that he loved most, traveling to foreign places to forge new adventures. He was 33 years old.
