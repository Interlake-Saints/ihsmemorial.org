Richard Duncan Hoyt III, a pillar of the Cle Elum community, peacefully passed away at his home on June 3, 2024 at the age of 49, surrounded by family. Rich courageously battled cancer for 12 months while continuing to run his heavy equipment company.

Rich was born on November 8, 1974, in Kirkland, Washington to Rick and Christine Hoyt. He was raised in Bellevue and attended Interlake High School. He enjoyed outdoor activities from a young age, such as fishing and hunting. As an adult, his appreciation for the outdoors grew into an even greater passion for salmon fishing in Alaska, and being a Master Class Sporting Clays competitor.

Rich owned and operated, and took great pride in his heavy equipment company, "Hardline Construction." A longtime resident of Cle Elum, Rich was an integral part of the fabric of his tight-knit community. He was beloved by his neighbors, and was always ready to help those in need. He was usually found after work or on weekends holding court in his shop, which was his epicenter. 

He reunited with his high school sweetheart, Misty McCarty, in 2015. They were married in 2020 at their home, in the middle of a hayfield, where they rode off on a John Deere tractor.

Rich is survived by his wife, Misty Hoyt of Cle Elum, and his three stepchildren Darien, Gehrig and Brooklynn of Eugene, OR. He is also survived by his siblings Nicole Daub of Scottsdale, AZ; Alex Hoyt of Wenatchee, WA; and Zachary Hoyt of Olympia, WA.

The family is grateful for the outpouring of love and support during this difficult time. Rich's memory will remain in the hearts of his family, friends, and all those who were honored to have had the privilege of knowing him.
