Lynn, aka Lynn Suzanne Harris, was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints just before her senior year of high school. She then became very involved with the Bellevue Single Adult group and the Seattle 11th Singles Ward, which is where she met her eventual husband, Craig. She and Craig were married in Seattle on June 25, 1982.

Lynn and her family moved from Washington to Utah in June 1999. Shortly after moving to Utah, Lynn began working at the Snowbird Children's Mountain School. She and Craig also served as missionaries at the Conference Center for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Lynn served as a tour guide, a Friday night chairman, and a shift supervisor. She made many friends while serving at the Conference Center, and loved meeting people from all over the world who would come to take a tour. 

In March of 2019, Lynn and her family moved from Sandy, UT to South Jordan. Lynn loved to ride her electric bike on the trails all around the area. She especially like to ride around Oquirrh Lake and feed the ducks. She also liked to attend the free concerts during the summer. Her favorite bands were the Beach Boys and Beatles tribute bands. She was very active in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints throughout her life and held many leadership positions. Lynn also loved to go on cruises. Before Covid, she and Craig would go cruising with family and friends almost every year.

Lynn had many Christ-like qualities. She was loyal, loving, kind, a friend to everyone. She never said an unkind word about anyone, she would do anything for anyone, even if she had just met them. She was definitely an over-achiever. Whenever she was asked to do something, it was done to the highest quality standards and would usually include a personal touch that only she knew about. But above all else, she cherished her children and grandchildren. 

Sadly, Lynn passed away on August 9, 2023, from the effects of a severe stroke. She was surrounded by her husband and her four loving children and their spouses. She was 65 years old.
