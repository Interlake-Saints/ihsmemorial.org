Scott was the ASB Vice President while at Interlake, and he eventually joined the U.S. Navy, where he served our country for more than a decade. Later in life, he worked in the Seattle area as an HR manager for several large companies. Scott came down with an illness in late 2018, and after fighting it off he developed a serious infection, which he was not able to fight off. He passed away on October 14, 2018. Scott will always be a larger than life figure among his hundreds of friends who loved him. He will be remembered as the boy, the man, who brought fun, friendship, and smiles into our lives, and he will be missed terribly.
