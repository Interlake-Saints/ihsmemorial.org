Denise, aka Denise C. Torgerson, went to The University of Washington and also Cal State Northridge after graduating from Interlake. She then had a long career working for the VA Medical Center in Los Angeles. She spent more than twenty-five years in Southern California as a respected clinical researcher, coordinator, and documentarian. In fact, at one point, she was even nominated for a Peabody Award. She was also the primary designer of the VA hospital's safety and compliance software. 

In her spare time outside of work, she was a lector at her church.

Sadly, Denise passed away of heart failure on January 19, 2019, in Van Nuys, California. She was 67 years old. She is survived by her longtime partner Lue Deck, who is a well-known L.A. comedian.
