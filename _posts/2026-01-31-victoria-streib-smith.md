Victoria’s first nine years were spent in Bedford, MA. Her family moved to Bellevue in 1967, where her father worked for Boeing.

After graduating from Interlake, she earned a bachelor’s in General Science from Evergreen State College. She then went on to the University of California, Berkeley, where she earned a master’s in Soil Science. During this time, she met Michael Jenkins at the 1986 Agronomy Meetings in New Orleans. Michael started courting Victoria not long after that meeting. Victoria accepted his overtures, and they were married on Father’s Day 1988.

Their life then became peripatetic - moving from Riverside, CA to San Diego, then to Braunschweig, Germany, and then to New York, where Victoria started working for the National Resource Conservation Service. Her job entailed mapping soils in southwestern New York. After Mike got a research position with the U.S. Agricultural Service, and their son Tycho was born in 1999, the family moved to Athens, Georgia, where Victoria started a writing business. In 2012, Victoria and family moved to Oxford, Mississippi, where Victoria started an Emotions Anonymous group, was an active member of the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Oxford, and participated in many art activities. 

Victoria passed away in Seattle on February 24, 2018, when she was home taking care of her aging parents. She was 59 years old.
