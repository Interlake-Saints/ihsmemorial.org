It is with great sorrow and regret that we share that our sister, Laurelee LaPlante, died on Saturday, February 15, 2020 in Washington, DC. Having lived with and battled against her depression, bipolar disorder, personality disorder, and addiction, she eventually succumbed to her mental health illness. Laurelee suffered her mental illnesses valiantly as the disorders shifted her perspective and poisoned her mind. We suspect the cause of death was suicide, and mention it to help raise awareness and save others lives. Laurelee will always be remembered for her huge smile and welcoming disposition. She had a huge heart and wanted to help people and animals in any way she could. She was a great storyteller. She had an innate way of drawing you in with her energy, wrapping you so tightly into the tale that it felt like you were living in it yourself. Laurelee will always be remembered for her courage during difficult times, and even though she took her life we know sheâ€™s at rest now without pain. The world lost someone beautiful this week.
