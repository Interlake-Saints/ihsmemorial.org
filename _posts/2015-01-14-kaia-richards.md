Kaia was blessed with great creativity and was always making beautiful creations out of almost anything. She was also a great student with her teachers always commenting that she was a pleasure to have in class. Recently Kaia developed an interest in learning to play guitar and with hard work and dedication quickly progressed and gave several live performances.
