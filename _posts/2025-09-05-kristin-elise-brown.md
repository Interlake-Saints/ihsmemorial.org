It is with profound grief that we announce the death of Kristin Brown, beloved daughter, sister, cousin, aunt and friend, who passed away in Richmond, Virginia on June 11, 2024. She was 47 years old.

Claiming herself to be the funniest Brown sister, besides wisecracks, Kristin was passionate about travel, good food, dogs and human rights. An exuberant traveler, she visited Canada, Mexico, Italy, England, France, Thailand, and Indonesia during her lifetime, and was always planning her next trip. Kristin lived in Okinawa, Japan, from 2015-2020, where her quest for the perfect bowl of ramen was unrivaled. Every time she got together with her friends and family, she always sought out the most authentically delicious meals.

Kristin was a fiercely independent person who stood up for herself and others - the exact comrade you wanted to have on your side in a dispute or a movement. Her protest signs at the Womenâ€™s March in October 2022 showcased her fierce funniness so much that she made the news. Kristin had a special bond with her late brother, Brian, and her family nostalgically recalls the countless scrapes and adventures they got into - which continued far into adulthood.

Kristin was a loyal, fun-loving friend who was always down for a late night chat, an online 1:1 book club, or a British detective show binge. Although her family expected that they'd have more time to make new memories, they are deeply grateful to have shared 47+ years on this planet with "Wissy", and will carry forward her positive influence on their lives for the remainder of theirs. Smile through your tears as you remember Kristin, then turn that pain into fuel to fight for a fairer, kinder world in her honor.

Sadly, Kristin is not the only member of her family on this page. Her brother, [Brian Scott "Quimby" Brown](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1996/brian-scott-brown/), passed away in December of 2015.
