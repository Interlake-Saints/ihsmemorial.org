B﻿ill was the captain of the 1969 IHS football team, and an all-conference linebacker, and he helped lead Interlake to two consecutive Kingco championships. After Interlake, he held a variety of jobs. He eventually retired from Verizon as a manager, but his favorite job ever was a defensive driving instructor. Many years later, he still had students contacting him to let him know he was the best teacher they ever had. That always made him so happy.

B﻿ill spent sixty-seven of his seventy years in Washington State, and always referred to himself as "just a country boy from Bellevue." Aside from football, he grew up riding and showing horses. He was also a member of several bands. He didn't meet his wife Lori until he was in his fifties, but they spent twenty years together and later wound up with ten grandchildren. Being a good dad, grandpa, brother, and husband was the most important to him.

S﻿adly, on July 6, 2022, Bill lost his four-year struggle with cancer. He was 70 years old.
