Jim was involved in sports at Interlake, including football (linebacker and running back), as well as track and field (high jump and pole vaulting.) He was offered a full track and field scholarship to the Air Force Academy, but instead chose to make his way down to Los Angeles to try his luck in the music and film industry.

He found success as a drummer in the country band Von Cotton, and was also co-owner of a popular L.A. club called the Piano Bar. In addition, in his later years, he became a location manager for several major film studios - working on projects such as Hacks, Westworld, and Star Trek Picard, just to name a few.

Jim fiercely loved life and those who filled it with the same love and laughter that he gave so easily to others. He was a magnificently brilliant shining star, and the world is just a little darker because he is no longer in it. He will be painfully missed by those he leaves behind.

Sadly, Jim passed away at his home in Hollywood on July 18, 2025. He was 49 years old.
