Anna Caitlin Spier, 38, passed away peacefully on Sunday, September 14, 2025. She was surrounded by her mother, father and sister.

Anna had Rett Syndrome, a rare genetic-based neurological disorder that primarily affects females. She was non-verbal and had no purposeful use of her hands. She struggled to walk later in life and had severe rigidity for the last few years. She was able to achieve a full and happy life in spite of the significant disability caused by the disease.

Anna was born in Atlanta, Georgia, the first child of Richard and Susan (Cloys) Spier. Her bright intellect developed early, but her physical skills lagged. After many consultations with experts, she was enrolled in a special needs preschool, the Model Classroom in Marietta, GA. At the Model Classroom she was taught Facilitated Communication, a technique that helped her type on a keyboard. Using this technique, Anna was able to "talk" to her parents. She used facilitated communication to tell her family what she needed, make comments about her thoughts, likes and dislikes, and feelings throughout her life. At the end, she was able to tell them she loved them and was at peace with dying.

Anna went on from the Model Classroom to special needs classes at Alpharetta Elementary and North Springs Elementary Schools in the Atlanta area. She was also involved in Ray-Thomas Presbyterian Church in Marietta, and Roswell Presbyterian Church, where she met dear friends and loving caregivers. She moved to Whitefish, Montana, in 2000, and attended Whitefish Middle and High Schools. She moved to Clyde Hill, WA in 2006, and was a student at Interlake for her final years in special education. Her family are very grateful for the many people who showed interest in helping Anna live a fulfilling life. There are too many teachers, aides, paraprofessionals, and support staff/volunteers to name individually, but Anna’s family is grateful to each one.

After she finished public school, Anna enjoyed the day program at Tavon Center in Issaquah, which greatly contributed to her quality of life in adulthood. She followed cooking shows, DIY shows, and the Seattle Seahawks on television when she was at home. Her collection of Seahawks fan gear was ever expanding, and she never missed a game.

Although she was cared for at home most of her life, by both her mother and father and their respective spouses, she entered Assurecare Adult Family Home in January 2025. There she could have some independence from her parents and receive safe and loving care from experienced professionals. Many thanks to Eduard, Angelo, Jerry and Lori for the loving care and compassion they showed Anna and her family, and to co-resident Kathleen for being Anna’s “best friend”. The hospice staff at Evergreen, and Dr. Andrew Hahn, her Palliative Care and Hospice specialist, were especially helpful, as well.

Anna is survived by her father, Richard Spier (Patricia Rovzar) of Clyde Hill, WA, her mother Susan Seaman (Brad Seaman) of Snohomish, WA, her sister Molly Spier (James Sullivan) of Seattle, WA, and her grandmother, Paula Cloys of Concord, NC. Aunts, uncles, cousins and friends from around the country also made up the host of people who knew and loved Anna.
