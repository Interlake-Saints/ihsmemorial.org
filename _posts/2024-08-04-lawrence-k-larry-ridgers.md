Larry graduated from Interlake in 1985. After school, he became a chef working at Schwartz Brother Restaurants. He started off at The Sandwich Shop and Pie place in Bellevue Square, but quickly moved up to their fine dining restaurants. 

He moved to Arizona for a while, cooking in different restaurants, learning what he could about the Southwest flavors. But he eventually found his way back to the Northwest. After coming back to Washington, he took it easy for a bit as a private chef.

Larry died of natural causes on July 9th, 2024. He died peacefully in his sleep.
