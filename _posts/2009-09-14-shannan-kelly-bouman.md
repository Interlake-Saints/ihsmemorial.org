Shannan was born with a congenital lung condition and she spent most of her life battling breathing difficulties. She passed away of respiratory problems on September 14, 2009. She was 36 years old.

Sadly, Shannan isn't the only Bouman with an entry on the IHS Memorial Page. Her brother [Martin](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1976/martin-jan-bouman/) is listed under the Class of 1975. Shannon and Martin were siblings either through adoption, or through the foster program.
