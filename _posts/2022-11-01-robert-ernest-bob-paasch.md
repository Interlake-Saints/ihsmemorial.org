B﻿ob was a great athlete at Interlake, lettering in three sports his senior year in 1971. He was also a lifelong golfer, and was part of a regular Sunday game with his friends for years. He was a graduate of Washington State University, and later went on to be the owner of Pacific Color in Seattle. Sadly, he passed away on July 29, 2022.

Bob had a unique wit and a big heart. H﻿e was famous for entertaining people at his house, and his large get-togethers. He had many, many friends who will miss him.

U﻿nfortunately, Bob is not the only member of the Paasch family on the IHS Memorial Wall. His older brother, [Ralph](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1970/ralph-jay-paasch/), passed away back in 2002.
