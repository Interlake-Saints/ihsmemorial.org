Tom was an accomplished athlete, playing football for the Mead Panthers in Spokane, the Interlake Saints in Bellevue and Montana State University. He graduated from Interlake in 1979 then attended Montana State and Western Washington State University, earning a Bachelor’s of Arts degree in Business Administration and Economics. 

Tom had an interesting career, coaching football at both Western and Eastern Washington State Universities. Many former students still call him “Coach” but, more importantly, they remember the positive influence he had on their lives. He remained an avid football fan throughout his life. Tom also served as an Investigator with the United States Treasury Department. In 2008 Tom opened a private practice as a licensed private investigator and was a qualified instructor for the National Highway Transportation System in DUI Detection and Standardization Field Sobriety Testing Programs. Tom was a highly sought after and valued expert witness for DUI defense attorneys across Washington State.

Outside of work, Tom proudly served on the Roslyn City Council and was a member of the Kittitas County Council. Roslyn locals knew him as the Mayor of the Brick Tavern, the Self-Appointed Sheriff of Roslyn, or the Local Parking Czar, but everyone knew and loved him for his genuine kindness, integrity, generosity, quick wit, and his smile. He will be greatly missed by everyone. 

Tom Missel passed away peacefully on October 21, 2023 at his home in Roslyn with his wife by his side. He was 62 years old.
