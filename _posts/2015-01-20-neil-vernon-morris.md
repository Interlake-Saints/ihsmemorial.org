Four years before he died, Neil had to undergo a liver transplant. After that, he knew he was on borrowed time. He got healthy after that, and lived every day to the fullest, playing his bass guitar, gigging right up to the last week of his life. He passed away after a short illness on January 20, 2015, at Renown Hospital in Reno, NV with his family by his side. He was 58 years old.
