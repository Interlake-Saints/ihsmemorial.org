It’s with sadness and joy that we announce the passing of our beloved sister, aunt, great-aunt, cousin, and friend, Ruth Angela Vowels. She died peacefully during the night on February 26, 2024, after many years of illness. Ruth lived an adventurous and independent life and will be an enduring inspiration to all those she touched.

Ruth had several serious illnesses as a child, and was diagnosed with significant learning disabilities at the age of seven. In search of better opportunities for Ruth, her family moved to Bellevue in 1966, which had a school district with programs for kids with learning disabilities. Ruth never complained about her learning disabilities or let them slow her down. As a matter of fact, she’d argue she was normal and YOU'RE the one with issues!

Ruth thrived, worked hard, and was always anxious to learn, which helped her graduate from Interlake in the class of 1974. After high school she was ambitious and continued to have a thirst for learning and improving herself. She completed programs at Kenmore Beauty School and Gene Juarez School. Ruth worked full-time for over thirty years at several different jobs, including major corporations like Marriott, Microsoft, and Pro Health Club. She was a conscientious and dependable employee, often getting to work an hour early just so she could get a jump on the workday.

At Microsoft, Ruth worked for several years as a valued member of a manufacturing team. Her team was, in fact, the centerpiece of the memorable Windows 95 product, which was the biggest packaged product software launch in the history of all software companies worldwide.

Before she had a driver’s license, Ruth memorized bus schedules. She loved exploring the greater Seattle area. She eventually desired more independence, and she worked hard to get a driver’s license. With her driver’s license in hand, she took weekend roadtrips to places like Long Beach and Birch Bay. 

Ruth was very good at compensating for what she didn’t know, and she learned how to use resources at the public library to always improve her skills.  She enjoyed listening to audio books, watching movies, and learned how to quilt. Ruth loved her nieces and nephews and enjoyed spending time with them. Ruth’s zest for independence and adventure took her on international cruises, and even on a trip to Ireland all by herself. 

One of Ruth’s most enjoyable things to do as an adult was to compete in the Special Olympics bowling and golf events, where she won numerous medals. Ruth also walked away with the coveted Hat Island Golf Championship!

In 2013, Ruth’s health began to wane, and she eventually lost her treasured independence. With her usual disdain for giving in, she fought hard against the inevitable. It was time for her to give up her beloved driver’s license, her aspirations of more adventure, and move into a stage of total dependence. Ruth suffered from many illnesses over her lifetime, including Lewy Body Dementia.

Even though she died at 67, Ruth accomplished many things in her lifetime. Which is especially impressive, considering her disabilities. And of course, you can’t talk about Ruth without talking about her “lattes”. She loved them all, no matter what you put into them. When Ruth was healthy, the first thing she would do in the morning was go to her favorite barista, sit in her favorite chair, sip her coffee, and watch everyone around her come and go. Once Ruth became ill, if you showed up to visit her with a latte, her eyes lit up and her arms reached out. Every time.
