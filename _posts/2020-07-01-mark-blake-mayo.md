Mark excelled in baseball at IHS, in fact his picture still stands on the wall in the Interlake Hall of Fame. After high school, he continued to play baseball for UW, EWU, Edmonds CC and later, semi-pro baseball. Mark was also an extraordinary golfer. He worked as an Assistant Pro at Seattle Golf and Country Club while pursuing his PGA card. Mark's career in sales eventually took him to Nordstrom, John L. Scott, and most recently, Landmark Motors. He was beloved by his clients and colleagues alike for his charm, his charisma, and his Nordstrom-style of service. But nothing was more important to Mark than his children. He always doted on them as their coach, and their number one cheerleader, and they will always know that their dad is out there, rooting for them. Sadly, Mark passed away on July 1, 2020. He was 56 years old.
