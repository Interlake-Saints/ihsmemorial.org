Mark, who was known as "Perk" to his friends, joined the United States Navy after high school, where he served as a drill instructor and a member of the Navy's Presidental Honor Guard. He was very proud of his service for his country, as he helped bury our war heroes in Arlington, and also helped protect presidents Ford and Carter in the White House.

After retiring from the Navy, Mark became a certified electrician, and he owned a company called Perkins Parts and Electrical. He eventually settled in Gillette, Wyoming, where he lived for the final twenty-five years of his life. He was well known the Gillette area as a safety inspector for local power industries and mines.

Sadly, Mark passed away on Thanksgiving Day, November 24, 2022, after an accident in his home.

Mark had many friends from the class of 1975, and he still kept in touch with many of them over the years. He was generous to a fault. His friends and family are devastated by his passing, and they are going to miss him.
