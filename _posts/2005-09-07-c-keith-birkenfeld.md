Keith Birkenfeld, educator, world traveler and philanthropist, died on September 7, 2005, following ongoing complications from open-heart surgery. Prior to the surgery, which forced his retirement, he spent twenty years in the Bellevue School District as a high school teacher of international relations and U.S. History, and later as an administrator.
