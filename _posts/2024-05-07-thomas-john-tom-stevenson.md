Tom was an accomplished chef, gardener, painter, musician, and master of sarcasm who spent his entire life in the Seattle/Bellevue area. 

He gained a culinary arts certificate from South Seattle College, and went on to work in many restaurants around the area, including Metropolitan Grill, Ponti Seafood Grill, Ivar’s Captains Table, and others. Tom loved entertaining, making big family meals or catering events for his mother’s tennis and golf ladies.

An accomplished artist, Tom's paintings can be found around the homes of family and friends. One of his favorite subjects to paint was pets. He had a fondness for dogs, particularly Boxers. Tom was also an avid antique collector and thrifter, with a vast knowledge of antiques and their value.

His love of gardening led him to his own landscaping business, beautifying gardens and yards all over the Seattle metro area. He enjoyed traveling, and made trips to Hood Canal, Tucson, Santa Barbara, Park City, Utah, Catalina Island, Costa Rica and San Francisco. He tried to give back to organizations that helped him, volunteering time to feed those in need. He also taught many friends how to play the guitar. Tom could play almost any tune on demand. His guitars were among his most prized possessions.

Tom will be remembered as a really nice gentle guy, who was smart, interesting, sensitive, funny, a great guitar player, and a pleasure to be around. 

Sadly, he passed away in Bellevue on April 6, 2023. He was 60 years old.
