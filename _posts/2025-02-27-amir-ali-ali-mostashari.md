With heavy hearts, we announce the death of Amir Ali Mostashari, who passed away on January 12, 2025 at the age of 62. 

Though Amir Ali may no longer walk beside us, their memory will forever be enshrined in the fabric of the lives of those Amir Ali touched, a beacon of light guiding us through the darkness. In their absence, their spirit lives on — a gentle whisper in the breeze, a ray of sunlight on a cloudy day, a reminder that love knows no boundaries.

S﻿adly, Ali is not the only member of his family on this page. His younger sister [Tina](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1991/tina-mostashari/) died in 1994.
