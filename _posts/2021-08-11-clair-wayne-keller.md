When Interlake opened in 1967, Clair Keller was a member of the very first history department. He taught American History as part of an innovative new teaching team with Jim Morgan. 

Keller left Interlake after one year, and wound up taking a position at Iowa State University, where he taught from 1968 until 2002. He pioneered many methods for teaching social studies and history over the years, and mentored many student teachers around the state of Iowa. He also started the Iowa History Day program, annually taking the young winners to Washington, D.C., for the national contest.

Clair is remembered for his many portrayals of George Washington in programs with children and adults in Iowa and other states. In fact, after retiring, he continued to teach history through the College for Seniors program at Iowa State. Even though he only taught at Interlake for one year, a lot of his students still remember him fondly.

Dr. Clair Keller passed away from complications of Alzheimerâ€™s disease on Nov. 19, 2017.
