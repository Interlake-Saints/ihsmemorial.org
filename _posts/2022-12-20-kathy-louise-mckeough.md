Kathy, aka Kathy L. Kunka, attended Central Washington University in Ellensburg, and she later settled in Indianola, WA, with her husband Bill and their two daughters, Haley and Karly. And according to her friends, she was "the funniest hippie cowgirl best friend ever!" She had an amazing, unique sense of humor, and she was known for uttering the phrase "I don't want to grow up!" She made her friends laugh until they cried.

Kathy worked on the Kingston-Edmonds ferry for many years, and she also loved Market Spice tea parties, traveling to Hawaii, and the Wizard of Oz. She made the best salmon dinners ever. She was a true giver of love, laughs, kindness, and funniness. 

Sadly, Kathy passed away on November 4, 2022.

"I bet up in Heaven, they're laughing hard right now."
