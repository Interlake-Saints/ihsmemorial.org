Tracey was born August 19th, 1961 in Pocatello, ID. He was raised in Bellevue, and he graduated from Interlake in 1979. He followed this up with an Industrial Plant Maintenance degree from Lake Washington Vocational Institute in 1984.

Tracey was very intelligent and skilled with his hands. He worked for 35 years in Redmond in the aerospace industry. In retirement, he loved traveling, golfing, fishing, and visiting his children and grandchildren. He also spent most of his adult life cultivating memories on his “little funny farm”- a haven for wayward animals. Tracey was a ferocious reader, an avid gardener, an amazing cook, and a lifelong outdoorsman. He was always ready for a “quest” - no matter the destination.

Always the social butterfly, Tracey was known for being able to be anywhere, in any situation, making meaningful lasting connections, turning any event into a memory. He impacted and nurtured so many lives with his wisdom, his integrity, his compassion, and an open ear.

Sadly, Tracey Clay Bailey, our fun-loving and devoted “Pops”, died suddenly on Thursday, June 6th, 2024, due to complications from a ruptured aorta. He was 62 years old.
