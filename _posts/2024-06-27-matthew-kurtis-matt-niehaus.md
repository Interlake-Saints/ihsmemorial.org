Matt was born in Southern California, and moved up to Bellevue with his family at the age of 10. He made new friends with ease, and played little league and soccer during his youth. He adored his pets. First, our family dog Sitka, and then his dog Hutch, and most recently Echo.

As a young adult, Matt moved to Phoenix, where he worked as an electrician. He was known for being kind, smart, funny, and generous to everyone. A very compassionate person, Matt would see a stranger in need and drop everything he was doing to offer his help. So it was not surprising to find out that he was an organ donor. We know he is pleased that his donation helped to extend the life of another stranger.

On March 27, 2024, Matt left us unexpectedly and way too soon when he suffered a heart attack. He was 56 years old. He joins his beloved father, Dave Niehaus who passed away in 2010. He is survived by his loving mother Marilyn, brother Andy, and sister Greta. He is missed immensely by many friends and extended family members every day.
