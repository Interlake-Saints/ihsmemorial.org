Alicia, aka Alicia Smith Johnson, was living in Idaho in December of 2022 when she developed an encephalopathy (a disease that affects the brain). It was not curable and it quickly overtook her body. Her daughter brought her to the hospital but Alicia was never able to recover. She finally took her last breath at 10:40 AM on February 2nd, 2023. She was surrounded by those who cared so much for her and so much love. 

Alicia's passing has left a void that can never be filled, but also a sense of peace that she will not have to suffer any more, and has found her way home. Her memory will live on in her children, grandchildren, and all those who were impacted by her life. She is with the angels now.
