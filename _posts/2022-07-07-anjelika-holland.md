Anjelika died in a car crash  just south of Southcenter, on November 24, 2018. She was driving south on I-5 when the car in front of her slowed due to traffic. Anjelika swerved, but she hit the vehicle in front of her and then wound up impacting a guardrail. This led to her being hit by two other cars, the second of which killed her. She was only 21 years old.

Tragically, Anjelika's six-month old daughter, Arista, also died as a result of the crash. She was in the backseat of the car at the time of the accident. Arista died four days later in a local hospital.
