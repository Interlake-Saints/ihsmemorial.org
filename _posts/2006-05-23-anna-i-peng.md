Anna graduated from the University of Washington with an accounting degree, and moved to Louisiana to begin work. However, she missed her family back home, so five years later she moved back to Bellevue, got married, and lived just four blocks from Interlake. Sadly, she passed away unexpectedly, from natural causes, on May 23, 2006.

From her husband Brian: "Anna was a kind, loving person that brought extreme joy and happiness to my life. Although there was extreme sadness and grief for me after she passed away, I would not think twice about doing it over again. Nick Cave said, "if we love, we grieve. That’s the deal. That’s the pact. Grief and love are forever intertwined. Grief is the terrible reminder of the depths of our love and, like love, grief is non-negotiable." Although our marriage lasted much shorter than I hoped, it was an honor and privilege to be Anna's husband."
