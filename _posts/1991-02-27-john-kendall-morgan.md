Jack was the last person to die during Operation Desert Storm. On Feb 27, 1991, the helicopter he was piloting was shot down the day the cease fire was signed. They were transporting a medical crew back to port when they became disoriented and accidentally wound up in Kuwait airspace. Jack was only 28 years old.

An Army warrant officer, Jack was doing his second stint in the military. After graduating from Interlake in 1981, he served three years as an electrician's mate in the Navy. Then, after working for a year as an account representative for investment firms in New York and Atlanta, he joined the Army and received his wings in December 1989. He joined the Army because he wanted to learn to fly, his mother said.

After troops were deployed to the Middle East in the summer of 1990, Jack began learning Arabic. He was sent to the Persian Gulf theater a month before he died.
