After serving two tours in the Navy, Joe started his career as a teacher in the Seattle School District. But he eventually transferred to Bellevue, where he taught special education at Interlake up until his retirement in 2001. He then worked for the Bellevue School District, where he managed the football stadium for two more years.

When he wasn't teaching, Joe was a huge outdoorsman. He not only taught survival training in the Navy, he also loved crabbing and fishing, and was often found exploring remote bodies of water around the northwest. In fact, for years, he would attend the last day of class as a teacher, and then the next day hop on the first flight in the morning to Alaska, where he worked as a summer fishing guide. He also loved sailing and hunting, and exploring the country via trailer with his wife.

Sadly, Joe passed away unexpectedly on January 23, 2022. He was 76 years old. He will be dearly missed by his family and friends.
