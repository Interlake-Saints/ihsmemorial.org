Dennis Barger was a fixture at Interlake from the early 80s through the early 90s, where he taught distributive education and marketing, managed the student store, and was also the advisor for the pep squad and cheerleading teams. Outside of Interlake, he was also the manager at Music West, and he worked at the U & I Pharmacy in Bellevue.

Even though Interlake students would remember Mr. Barger as a teacher, his true passion in life was actually music. He attended the University of Oregon on a full music scholarship, he graduated with a degree in music education, and prior to teaching at Interlake, he was a full time music teacher. Later in life, he auditioned and became a member of the Seattle Symphony Chorale. In his spare time, he played guitar, wrote poems, and wrote music- mostly Christian. He sang in churches and weddings for many years. He will be lovingly remembered for his unceasing passion for all things musical.

Dennis Barger passed away in his East Wenatchee home on August 14, 2021, following a long battle with various illnesses. He was 80 years old.
