Tuomas was born in Bellevue, where he lived most of his life. At the age of 7 he moved temporarily to Helsinki, Finland with his family and returned 2 1/2 years later to Bellevue. Tuomas was about to start his sophomore year at Interlake where he was particularly interested in math, physics and all things related to computers, and seemed to excel at everything he participated in. He passed away unexpectedly on August 17, 2016. He was only 15 years old and left us way too soon.
