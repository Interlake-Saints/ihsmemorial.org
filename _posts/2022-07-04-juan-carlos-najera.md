Juan Carlos Najera, also known as Juan Carlos Najera-Chocoj, was the youngest of three brothers from Guatemala. He was a senior at Interlake in 2022, and he hoped to graduate in the summer, days before his 18th birthday. 

Juan Carlos was an active young man, as well as a lover of football, his school, and his family. At seventeen years old, he had already worked with the Dream Act to help his parents purchase a piece of land back home in Guatemala, where their plans were to one day build a family house.

Unfortunately, on March 25, 2022, after an active week of working, playing football in the park, and being happy to go to his work and school, without anyone understanding the reason, Juan Carlos decided to end his life. He was only seventeen years old.
