After Interlake, Chris married fellow '86 classmate [Tiffany Holt](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1986/tiffany-k-holt/). They had two boys together, Payton and Wyatt. Chris was an amazing guitar player who was known for his witty sense of humor, his passion for music, fishing, and a love of all animals. He is survived by his brother, Jeff, and two sons, and he will be dearly missed. 

Chris passed away unexpectedly on October 25, 2022. He was 54 years old.
