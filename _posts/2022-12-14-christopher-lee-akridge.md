After Interlake, Chris married fellow IHS graduate Tiffany Holt. They had two boys, Payton and Wyatt. Chris was an amazing guitar player, who was known for his witty sense of humor, his passion for music, fishing, and a love of all animals. He is survived by his brother, Jeff Akridge, and two sons, and he will be dearly missed. 

Chris passed away unexpectedly on October 25, 2022.
