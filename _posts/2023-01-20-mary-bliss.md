Mary Bliss was born with a rare genetic disease she unfortunately shared with all of her siblings. But that never stopped her from living a full life. She was a police officer in Washington State for a good portion of her life, and she also spent time as a young woman as a weightlifter. 

She moved to Arizona for the last few years of her life, and she did everything she could to live life to the fullest, despite having knee replacement surgery and bad legs. She loved the Beatles, loved the Seahawks and Mariners, loved photography, and above just about everything else, she loved animals. She was always especially passionate about her dogs.

Sadly, Mary passed away on December 4th, 2022, after a long battle with terminal illness.
