Mary Bliss was born with a rare genetic disease she unfortunately shared with all of her siblings. But that never stopped her from living a full life. She was a police officer in Washington State for a good portion of her life, and she also spent time as a young woman as a weightlifter. 

Mary moved to Arizona for the last few years of her life, and she did everything she could to live life to the fullest, despite having knee replacement surgery and bad legs. She loved the Beatles, loved the Seahawks and Mariners, loved photography, and above just about everything else, she loved animals. She was always especially passionate about her dogs.

Sadly, Mary passed away on December 4th, 2022, after a long battle with terminal illness.

Unfortunately, as to be expected when siblings share a genetic condition, Mary is not the only member of the Bliss family on the IHS Memorial Wall. Her older brother, [Kevin](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1974/kevin-malcolm-bliss/), and her older sisters, [Linda](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1979/linda-renee-bliss/) and [Carol](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1981/carol-christine-bliss/), also have entries on this page.
