Born on December 6, 1976, Chris was a free spirit who lived life on his own terms, embracing every twist and turn with courage and authenticity.

Chris had a deep love for the outdoors, finding peace in camping, gardening, and the simple beauty of nature. He was a prankster at heart, always finding clever ways to bring a smile to othersâ€™ faces, often leaving behind laughter and unforgettable stories. He found joy in the moments that mattered most. Sitting around a campfire, tending to his garden, or sharing laughter with those he loved. Known for his adventurous heart and infectious laughter, Chris had a knack for forming meaningful connections with others. He had a remarkable ability to make others feel seen, valued, and understood. His memory will leave a lasting impact on everyone who had the privilege of knowing him.

While his time with us feels too short, his impact on the lives of those who knew him will last forever. He leaves behind a legacy of love, laughter, and the reminder to live authentically. Chris will be deeply missed but lovingly remembered by his family, friends, and all who were touched by his light.

Chris passed away on January 11, 2025. He was 48 years old.
