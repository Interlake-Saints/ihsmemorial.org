George grew up in Bellevue, in the days when the area was thick with woods and trails. He shared an obsession with model trains and historic steam trains with his father. The rainy climate and access to eclectic radio stations were a perfect environment to foster a love of music, which became a fundamental part of his life.

After Interlake, George attended the University of Puget Sound, where he graduated with a B.A. in mathematics. During his undergraduate years, he balanced his studies with a couple of jobs that made a lasting impression in his life: working at Hermit's Rest in the Grand Canyon, and DJing for his college radio station. His love of music expanded over the years, and he was drawn to the extended improvisation of bands like the Allman Brothers and the Grateful Dead, which dovetailed with jazz, another favorite. He loved all genres of music, and was excited to introduce his family and friends to new artists.

George received his MBA in Finance from the Simon Business School in Rochester, NY. His work was his passion, and he went on to enjoy a successful career as an energy industry executive, including over twenty years at Puget Sound Energy. He worked in many areas including regulatory initiatives, corporate accounts and resource planning for hydropower and wind investments. He was known for his sense of humor and his afternoon "walk-abouts" - finding out what other areas of the company were doing.

George played as hard as he worked. His favorite adventures included climbing Mt. Rainier, scuba diving in Hawaii, running the Humboldt Redwoods Marathon, making pilgrimages to ride historic steam engines like the Silverton Durango, and skiing and hiking countless trails throughout the Rockies. He was always up for seeing the latest movie, never passed up dessert, and was a connoisseur of burgers. He went to hundreds of concerts, with favorites being Tom Petty, Government Mule, Bruce Springsteen and the Waterboys. He also loved travelling to other countries, and even took his mother on a momentous trip to Italy. In addition to enjoying all that our world has to offer, he also loved immersing himself in the adventures of the Rebel Alliance, the U.S.S. Enterprise, and Middle Earth.

George moved to Missoula, Montana in 2021 to be near family as he navigated a diagnosis of early onset Alzheimerâ€™s and Frontotemporal dementia. He continued to enjoy outdoor walks, good food and good company thanks to Harvest Home Care, before ultimately passing away on March 14, 2025. He was 57 years old.

Above all, George was good-humored, kind, giving, and supportive to everyone in his life who he loved. He was preceded in death by his father, George Pohndorf, Sr. and beloved dog Jack, who undoubtedly met George on the other side.
