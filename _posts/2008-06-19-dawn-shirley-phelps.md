Dawn graduated from Interlake in 1976. As a young adult she resided in Washington State near her mother. After her mother’s passing in 1993, she and her children moved to Texas to be closer to her father, who was a professor at the University of Texas at Austin.

Dawn worked many different jobs during her lifetime, but her most treasured job was that of a mother. She spent her days not only caring and nurturing her own children, but she also served as a foster care provider, and showed the same love and compassion to many other children. Dawn’s legacy will remain alive in the many hearts that she touched over the years.

Dawn passed away on June 19, 2008 in Austin, TX after a brief and sudden illness. She was 49 years old.
