Shane was born in Rockford, Illinois on October 25, 1971. At just 18 months old, he moved to Kirkland, Washington, where he would grow up and nurture his many passions.

Music was Shaneâ€™s earliest passion. By age five, he had his first drum set, and soon thereafter began piano lessons. His talents shone in school plays and bands, and at thirteen, he appeared in a local commercial for Frederick & Nelson Department Store, showcasing his natural charisma. As he matured, Shane continued to share his musical gifts with others, performing in numerous bands, including a memorable appearance at the 2013 Bite of Seattle festival.

In 2006, Shane married Shannon Wiley. Their partnership, though it later came to an end a few years after, remained a significant chapter of his life.

Shane was a dynamic and dedicated salesman, recognized for his energy and ability to connect with people. He worked for several technology companies, earning many top sales awards throughout his career. In 2021, he moved to Gilbert, Arizona, and more recently contributed his talents to FirstNet, an AT&T division focused on serving first responders and those who help others.

Known for his warmth, charisma, and drive, Shane leaves behind memories etched in music, connection, and kindness. He touched those around him with energy and empathy. He is remembered with love by those whose lives he enriched. May his legacy of passion, resilience, and joy continue to inspire.
