Alena was born with a rare genetic mutation called Ataxia Telangiectasia. Although she could never comb her own hair or brush her own teeth, when she was thirteen she discovered horses - and *Little Bit Therapeutic Riding Center* in Woodinville took her under their wing. Alena became an accomplished western rider, and was invited to compete in horse shows all over the United States. She rode horses for many years before passing away at home of cancer on September 12, 2011. She was 48 years old.

Sadly, Alena's younger brother [Bill](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1985/william-everitt-bill-sorm/) is also listed on this page. He died in 2021, and can be found under the Class of 1985.
