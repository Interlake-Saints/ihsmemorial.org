Jo Ann, aka Jo Ann Elaine Nelson, was born in Bellevue, and she spent most of her childhood in Bellevue and the Bellevue School District. She attended Interlake up through her junior year, although she technically didn't graduate from Interlake. She moved to California before her senior year, and graduated from Agoura High School in 1984. She later earned her Court Reporting Certification in the 90s, and spent her career working as a court reporter in various municipalities around Arizona and Kansas. 

Jo Ann was genuine and kindhearted. She was a sweet soul who enjoyed making friends and serving others. She was a warrior too, who would not back down from what she believed in. She loved quilting and gifted many quilts to others. She had a special place in her heart for animals, loved the outdoors, and enjoyed going elk hunting with her dad. Growing up, she played the piano, flute, and piccolo. At Interlake, she was in the marching Band and sang in choir. She also loved ice skating, and was in many youth competitions.

She wasnâ€™t afraid of trying new things. Later in life she found a passion for refinishing the floors of her 100 year old home, making beautiful jewelry out of silverware, and continued her love of quilting. She loved researching her family genealogy and Cherokee Indian Heritage.

Jo Ann was a single mom and she fiercely loved her children, raising them to be strong and independent. No matter what, they always knew she loved them.

Sadly, Jo Ann passed away on January 25, 2025. She was 58 years old.

She will be missed by so many, but her love will live on in our hearts.
