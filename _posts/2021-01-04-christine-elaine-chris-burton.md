Christine, aka Christine Elaine Taylor, was born December 21, 1964 in Seattle, and was raised in Bellevue. She graduated from Interlake in 1983. She went on to earn an ADN in nursing in 1990 and worked at Overlake Hospital for over 13 years, where she cared for cancer and critical cardiac patients. Following her time as a nurse, Chris began a successful career in business development and sales.

Everyone who knew Chris knew she had a contagious laugh and that her smile could light up a room. Her presence in the Sammamish community will be greatly missed by those who knew and loved her.

Chris passed away suddenly at her home in Sammamish on January 4, 2021 from heart failure. She was 56 years old.
