Jacque Spillman was a travel agent for over twenty-five years, and her clients became her close friends. She loved traveling all over the world, in particular cruises with her mother and other dear friends. She also loved books, cooking, sending cards, collecting Pioneer Woman, and loving her dogs, as they were her children and also her world. She was loved by many and will be missed by all.

Sadly, Jacque passed away at her home in Rockledge, Florida on March 6th, 2022. She was 56 years old.
