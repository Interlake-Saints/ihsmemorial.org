After graduating from Interlake in 1972 (he was a member of the first freshman class), Ken further pursued his education at Seattle University and the University of Redlands, eventually earning his Masterâ€™s Degree in Business Administration. Ken was exceptionally intelligent and he always had a passion for learning. 

As a United States Marine, Ken's place of work was not limited to just one location. He courageously served his country across the globe, consistently holding himself to the highest standards of the Corps, no matter the task at hand. His dedication and unwavering commitment to his role as a Colonel and Logistician brought honor to his name, and left a lasting impact on all who had the pleasure of working alongside him.

In addition to his remarkable military career, Ken was also an active member of his community. He generously offered his time and expertise to various organizations, including the Escondido Community Foundation, Escondido Rotary Club, RYLA Counselor, Kiwanis Club of Escondido-Highland Valley, San Diego Children's Discovery Museum, San Diego Track Club, MCRD Museum Foundation, San Rafael Parish, and he served as a sponsor for RCIA. He also dedicated his coaching prowess, mentoring aspiring athletes as a Track Coach for the Women's Track Club, Cal State University, and the Rancho Santa Fe School. Ken's commitment to helping others will always be remembered and appreciated.

Ken cherished his role as a husband, father, and grandfather, though words cannot express the depth of his love for each of them. His family members were the lights of his life, and his legacy will live on through each and every one of them.

Sadly, Ken left us unexpectedly on November 3, 2023, in the comfort of his own home in Rancho Bernardo, California. But he will always be remembered as man who led a fulfilling long life, full of love, laughter, and incredible achievements.
