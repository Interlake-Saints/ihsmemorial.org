Cami, aka Cami Menard Martlin, was an esthetician, a massage therapist, an educator, and a mother to her beloved only child, [Max](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-2017/max-hunter-martlin/) (who was also an Interlake grad - class of 2017). Cami and Max loved doing things together, which makes their story all that more tragic. Cami and Max both died on the afternoon of October 24, 2021. They were driving home together from Fall City, after picking pumpkins for Halloween, when their car was crushed by a tree that had snapped off in a windstorm. They were both killed instantly. Cami was 59 years old.

Cami and Max's tragedy was featured all over local news in the days after it happened, and it eventually even made the national news. It later became a cover story in People Magazine.

Cami was so loved in this life. She and Max will be missed.

Uï»¿nfortunately, Cami is not the only Menard sister listed on this page. Her older sister, [Babette "Babs" Menard Kratz](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1973/babette-aline-babs-menard/), passed away three years later, in 2024.
