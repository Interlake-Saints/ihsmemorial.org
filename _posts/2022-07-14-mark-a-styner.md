Mark was well-known in his local youth sports community, as he coached his son's baseball, basketball, and soccer teams, not to mention the local middle school basketball, soccer, and track teams. He worked in financial services for many years before retiring in 2005, to become a stay-at-home dad and coach. 

Mark died peacefully at Evergreen Hospice Center on March 14, 2022, after months of declining health due to a rare autoimmune condition. He was 62 years old. He is survived by his wife Debra, his son Ian, his father Mark, his siblings Susan and Jon, and many nieces, nephews, and friends.
