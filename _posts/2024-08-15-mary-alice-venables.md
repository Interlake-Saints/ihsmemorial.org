Mary was born on May 1, 1962 in Seattle. And she was part of a large and loving family, including three older sisters, one younger sister, and one younger brother. Not a typical middle child, Mary was a future matriarch from the beginning: protective, nurturing, and opinionated. Mary delighted in organizing her siblings -older, younger, and adoptive alike- and expressing her pleasure (or displeasure) at the family's many adventures. She was fiercely loyal, and a tireless cheerleader.

Mary graduated from Interlake in 1980, and earned a degree in computer science from Bellevue Community College. Mary loved children and pursued this passion by working in child care for many years. After earning her degree, she joined the technical sector, and finished her work life at Boeing. Mary's career was marked by her passion for teaching, a curiosity for investigation and problem-solving, and a love for teamwork. Some of Mary's dearest friends started as co-workers and grew to become members of Mary's expansive circle of adopted family. Mary's gift for including people could be seen at any family gathering, which were always full of food and friends.

Mary was unapologetically stubborn, but always willing to consider someone else's point of view. Her force of will and keen attention inspired a life full of people she loved and interests that she pursued passionately. Her many hobbies included gardening (particularly roses), genealogy, knitting, tie dye, attending concerts, following Dancing with the Stars, cheering on the Mariners, celebrating holidays extravagantly, and watching old movies. Mary's greatest passion of all was her family (related and chosen), to whom her generosity was legendary. Mary always provided for others when they were in need.

While Mary never married, she was an extraordinary aunt, mentor, and support to her many nieces, nephews, and great nieces. She was a loving sister and best friend to her brother and sisters. She enriched our lives with her love, her generosity, and her kindness. She will be missed.

Sadly, Mary died unexpectedly on September 7, 2023, due to complications of a bacterial infection in her kidneys, while on vacation in Paris, France with her siblings. She was 61 years old.
