Matt loved sports, and he was a standout baseball player during his years in Bellevue. He also played on the IHS football team. He was known for his infectious laugh, big broad smile, practical jokes, and very kind heart. Sadly, Matt went to be with his Lord on Friday, October 25, 2019. He had just turned 40 years old.
