Steve died on Sunday, May 28, 1972. He and his fiancee were rafting on the Yakima River, near Thorp, WA, when her raft flipped over. Steve walked along a railroad trestle to attempt to go out and rescue her, but as he was walking he was struck by a Burlington-Northern Train. He was a 20-year old Central Washington college student at the time.
