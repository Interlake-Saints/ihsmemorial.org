Born on September 21, 1972, in Alberta, Canada, David's life journey was marked by a profound love for music, an unwavering commitment to his loved ones, and a generous spirit that touched the lives of many.

Raised in Bellevue, amidst the serene beauty of the Lake Hills area, David's formative years were imbued with the values of compassion, creativity, and camaraderie. He attended Interlake High School and Bellevue Community College. David's thirst for knowledge was complemented by his innate musical talent and passion for performance.

On February 15, 2009, David embarked on a new chapter of his life when he married Meriann Hansen in the picturesque surroundings of Preston, Washington. Their union brought them to Redmond in 2021, where they built a home filled with love, laughter, and cherished memories.

David's musical prowess was legendary, and his soulful voice and skilled musicianship captivated audiences for years. As a member of the band "Los Nekkid Mariachi," he graced the stage at the Raging River every Tuesday night, sharing his passion for music with all who had the pleasure of listening. Whether playing the piano, guitar, or any instrument he could lay his hands on, David's musical genius knew no bounds.

Beyond his musical endeavors, David was a cherished friend, known for his warm heart and infectious laughter. He organized countless gatherings and camping trips, fostering bonds of friendship that transcended time and distance. His love for his grandchildren knew no bounds, and he shared his boundless generosity with those less fortunate, embodying the true spirit of compassion and kindness.

David leaves behind a legacy of love and laughter, cherished by his devoted wife, Meriann Hansen; his stepchildren, Ian Ellis, Marina Ellis Bridenbaugh, and Emily Ellis Helenick; and his siblings, Jacobi Klappenbach, Phil Hansen, Colleen Marie Weigand (deceased), Amy Larson, Julia Reynolds, Kimi Weldon, and Jim Hansen. He was the beloved son of Dr. Mulloy Hansen and Lu Jeanne Hansen, and a doting grandfather to four grandchildren, alongside a host of extended family members.

In the melody of life, David's song will forever echo in our hearts, a testament to the enduring power of love, laughter, and the music that binds us all together.

David passed away peacefully at his home on Sunday, March 17, 2024. He was 51.
