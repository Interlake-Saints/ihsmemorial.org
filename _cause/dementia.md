Dementia is a progressive decline in brain function, including the brain cells that control movement and swallowing. Alzheimerâ€™s disease, the most common form of dementia, is the sixth leading cause of death for adults in the United States. However, [the actual number of deaths linked to dementia](https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/death-certificates-may-not-adequately-report-dementia-cause-death) may be about three times greater than what is reported on U.S. death certificates.
