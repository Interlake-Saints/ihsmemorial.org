In 2019, 5,044 people died from Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in the United States. AIDS is a relatively rare cause of death due to effective treatment protocols and prophylaxis. However, approximately 700,000 people have died from the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the US since it was first identified in 1981.
